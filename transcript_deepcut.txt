Under the Sun for over 30 minutes    please that is worrying you or for her to  come out of that kind of behavior or for    her to come out from this illicit Association  this never do well she is associating with    isn't that bothering you I'm asking you no I  didn't say anything wrong I'm only asking you    to forgive her that's all if you played your place  for a good cause I'm not for plead for this hour    darling daughter to continue with that boy okay  what have you seen in that voice what does he have  that kind of a person can be smoking ebook   and affect our daughter with smoking Igbo so maybe  some days if our girl returns from somewhere we    perceived smell of people will that be the end  result is it not showing our effort in vain huh  but I didn't do anything wrong Papa  you're calling me a fool that he didn't do  anything we observe you've been doing something    wrong as our daughter and we are trying to get you  out of it that Quagmire you're saying is

the only    man for me sister he's the only one I love that  will not happen no no no you will marry King  are you sure see one day can make so much  money and papa will have no choice  this is  okay choice  it just want somebody that can  take care of things that proper    action it tells differently because  I'm not sure it's about money alone   the everybody is to act it's as if I  don't know if I want me to get married    you don't even understand the king I'm not  sure you just knowing it's true but then I know    when Ken makes money you know less money so much Don't Worry Be Happy enough  okay  I need to do something and it has to be now  foreign but the question is what will I do should I run  away I I mean should can and I run from this place    no no that is not the best thing to do    but we can go to the city and hustle  like others so we can make money    I think that would be Papa accepting now  but where will he go   he knows no one in the city besides his  Wicked Uncle who has refused to help him  thank you  Beauty no I'm still on the way where are you going  and I just wanted to maybe  go to wee-wee with a bug with that  bag right there you want to go

thank you so much my friends  thank you  nice nine what are you doing all this now  why are you doing all this how can you go    around the whole village telling everyone that  cares to hear that they should one can that they    should stay away from her daughter what is  the meaning of that now I am safeguarding my   own uh if I calculate how much I spent of the  investing in our daughter I won't I won't play    with anybody who who is who is a layer about  who is not serious in in life to come here to    reap where he did not so I don't know my family is  but not for Ken yeah not for Ken so what it can do    to you what they did to me what did he do to me  it's not it does not work hard they must go and    reap where he sold not from from my family what  did he do in this family that I invested so much    in my daughter and he is now coming to reap  I don't see him meriting it no I won't allow    that if two of you have a partnered to achieve  that I'm telling you it won't work nine nine    you realize that this same can is the only child  and the only son to a widow he lies a poor Widow    and she can't afford to lose her son because  because he's loving your daughter sentimental    I was listening to you to tell me the achievement  of Ken he was saying we do what what do we do with    Widow and so on that one is uh ephemeral I always  say you make it costs no eyes it does not concern    me I have worked hard in my life and I have met  my daughter to go through hard work but to go and    direct scan where to read not in my family not  in my compound that's the point I've been making    oh wait wait wait wait wait wait till nine is it  this this little conversation we are having that  that's just I'm sure I'm making a point  I'm making a point I'm sure I'm making   a point no no not nine just listen to me I  want you to allow our daughter to be happy    love beauty to be happy Ken loves her daughter  they are in love so let them be actual when I    go married to you what did you have what did you  have you heard nothing or have you forgotten so   soon those who love our daughter are meaning what  I want is any man who will come my daughter's way    should be a man established to be hard worker  working hard so I've not recorded Ken as a    a person who works hard so he's coming  that this man has a a polished a woman    that he will just come and jump into I won't  allow that people must weep where they sold    Ken should go and reap where he has sued if he  has not sowed yet let him go and start afresh  I understand how difficult it is  to you I know you can't I know it's   difficult but try for once in your  life allow Beauty to be happy please  misleading her daughter I can't be party  to misleading our daughter our daughter    has threw my training enjoyed hard work so  let him reap through hard work not to come    from nowhere to to balance on our dining table  dining chair and we're eating chocolate no attack  it's not possible okay you don't want to listen  to what I'm saying no I'm listening to you but I    must not do what you are saying yeah and  if you don't want to do what I am saying    if you don't want to do the one I'm  saying in the daytime in the night   I will not do what you say can't die  Force you um look at what you wanted  marry him back  this one is challenging me I have seen goodness  so don't come here I paid all your dowries so    don't come and deny me anything each one I I  I I I ask you you give me at my back and call  I jump  away  no foreign what is the matter why are you crying    that means so much pain is  the reason I'm in despair  it's okay it's all right my dear stop crying okay  look I'm I'm sure he said all that out of anger    they can I know loves you so much I shouldn't  have spoken to him the way I did oh no don't say    that look I love the way you spoke that's  division okay so please stop crying mama    are you sure God will leave me oh no not at  all they can I know will never leave you he    loves you so much so don't worry I'm sure he  will come around everybody hopes he will I    hope so because Ken is my life mama I love him  so much he can't leave me I don't know if I'll    survive but I don't know please tell me what  do I do now okay listen to what you have to do  number one is that Ken loves you so much  forget that he doesn't have money now the    fact that he doesn't have money now does  not mean that you remain like that forever   look I've seen I've seen close that had so much  money so much when I mean so much so much money    there was no love in their marriage and because  there was no love in their relationship there was    no Joy of that before you say Jack that marriage  became problem rumbled and ended in bad news    telling you really feel one thing love is the  most important thing in every relationship love    see what's love him every other thing we made easy then  money cannot be taken away from any relationship    especially in marriage because when a man says he  loves you he needs money to grease that love yes    he needs money to take care of you he needs money  to make you happy he needs
