Was a little skeptical of ordering fresh fruit from Amazon. I absolutely love fruit and are picky about the freshness/ripeness. I pulled the trigger and wow they did not disappoint. No bruising and not overly ripe. 10/10 would order again.,1
Okay,0
The best strawberries I’ve ever tasted !,0
"I was so disappointed in these strawberries. I new I was taking a risk by produce sight unseen, but was so relieved when they arrived and were large and fresh. Then I ate them. The taste was horrible. They were so tart and tastless at the same time. I ate them with fruit whip and even that couldn't mask the flavor. Lesson learned. Never again!",2
The package looked good until I opened it. I found a few with mold already growing. I ended up having to throw them all away.,0
"The skin was thicker than I expected.  More skin than I am use to in a grapefruit.  No juice, not sweet.  Didn't really taste like grapefruit.  Will not order again.",2
"I bought these rings to use them as pinky rings.  My pinky is size 9.  I went through the rings and picked out all of the rings I wanted, and the rest I was able to gave away to friends.  It was an excellent purchase, and I will buy from this dealer again.  Love, Steve.",1
"Honestly, I was concerned about getting produce picked for me, but when I received it, it was great quality and I definitely will order again!",1
Both pieces were very small selections and they were not worth the amount I was charged for it.  I will never make a purchase like this again.,2
"Always fresh and delicious! Portions for 2 people nicely packaged. Always a delight: great flavor and fresh, fresh, fresh! I'll be buying this all the time. I am buying for one person so I eat one piece and freeze the other. Defrosts well and also tastes yummy.",1
Love love love!!! Best tasting strawberries and very fresh,0
This is the last time I'll be ordering bananas. This is how they arrive every single time. I am done now.,2
I am so mad about buying these bananas. I thought they would come in very yellow almost green but instead they came all black. It was so disgusting. I was basically given a bunch of bananas that were ready to be thrown away. Never again.,2
"Very happy with this product, but I won't buy next time, just bought for convenience, price a little high",2
"The salmon itself is just ok. I marinated and baked it and it was fine. Ordered from Amazon Fresh and it was indeed fresh but you need to be a safe cracker getting into the packaging. I appreciate the need for safe packaging and a responsibility to keep the product fresh, but there are no instructions for opening the sealed plastic container that two portions come in. If you notice the two videos here they don't show the packaging being opened. Took me a half hour to get the two pieces of salmon out without pulling them apart or damaging them. I'd compare it to how hard it is these days to get electronics out of their packages. I would not buy again even if it was the most delicious salmon I ever ate. Which it is not.",2
"I’ve been on the hunt for cute earrings that will hold up in the elements and won’t turn. These have been great so far! I’ve worn 2 pairs out of the pack so far. They are lightweight, and seems to be good quality! I would buy again!",1
"I wanted Halo mandarins but they were out of stock (seems to be a common occurrence with Amazon Fresh) so I thought I would try this 3 lb bag--BIG MISTAKE.  These mandarins were almost impossible to peel and when, after much struggle, I was able to get the rind off. I was left with the inner layer of the rind which clung to the mandarin..  It was either make juice (which if I wanted I would have ordered juice oranges) or eat the the white skin coated mandarins.  This is a NEVER AGAIN purchase from Amazon Fresh!",2
They were super fresh and tasted delicious. They were big strawberries too not the little small ones.,0
It looked like either it was rotted when it was delivered or it was handled roughly. Won’t be buying melons again.,2
Amazing! I love this and will definitely be buying this more often.. Taste so fresh that my taste buds thanked me for it...,1
"I've bright this product twice and both times bananas were bruised and rotten upon delivery. I don't think I'll be buying them again, I prefer bananas yellow, not brown!",2
Was fresh  juicy so I would buy again.,1
Love this product. The earrings are awesome. I highly recommend. I will order more,1
"I've made to fresh purchases and my first avacado was perfect. The one I received today was not any where near ripe AND has a huge rotten spot on it. Complete waste of money. My overall satisfaction with this fresh purchase was very, very low and I won't be buying from here any more. Sad, because my first purchase was great.",2
These were moldy the next morning after I received them. I shall not buy them again.,2
They are super cute and great for the price definitely  going to purchase more from this brand,1
I hesitated buying because most of the cantaloupe in the store is hard and not sweet. This cantaloupe was perfect. I would buy again.,1
"A little bland on flavor, much smaller than I thought for the price. Won’t buy again unless I really wanted salmon and was purchasing groceries online, as I was.",2
"Mine was ripe and fresh and sweet, but wouldn't reorder given the other reviews. Now I see why people actually buy HALF melons wrapped in plastic: SO THEY CAN SEE IT!",2
I would not buy these again! They are hard and no where near edible! Very disappointed.,2
"I cooked it same day and checked the package and looked really fresh, smelled like nothing. My husband hates seafood and I cooked it and he didn't even notice I cooked it. My Son had one piece and he loved it!! Buying again",1
"fresh , not very flavorful though",0
Just ordered these yesterday and the strawberries are moldy.,0
They are min but they taste just like you picked them from your garden that’s how good they are I will be buying these all the time love them I got my sister hooked on them,1
These were so fresh and ripe. They were firm but juicy! I would order more!!,1
Excellent,0
The value is acceptable,0
All of our produce has been excellent! Fresh and without blemish. My husband had a pear this morning that was just right.,0
"The oranges I got were absolutely huge compared to what I might have expected. They were literally the size of grape fruits. They were fairly good, although they had a lot of seeds. Like 20 seeds per fruit. Probably won't buy again, but the fruit I did receive were decent",2
The strawberries were fresh and sweet!,0
"They were great the first time, so I ordered more on Amazon Fresh a few days later and these ones were of a different brand and both packages were moldy! I tossed them in the trash and ordered another package on my next Amazon Fresh order and they weren’t so good. In fact, they tasted old and ripe and were about to turn soon. I’d say it’s very hit or miss with the fruit from Amazon Fresh, especially for delicate fruit like berries. And how could the packer not notice that there was mold on both packs?!",0
I’ll need to throw half the bag in the garbage. Won’t order again!!,2
This item was so small it was ridiculous. Avocados are usually small but this the item i got was as small as a child fist. I would not but this item again. Not worth the money.,2
"A great value, very fresh & will buy this again.",1
"This was awfull‼️  Hard fruit, Dry, No flavor. Like eating a Brick ‼️I don’t think that I would purchase this again‼️ ‼️",2
Really disappointed with the strawberries I received. The box seemed to have less than 1lb of strawberries and they were bad. No flavor and almost too ripe to eat.,0
The Amazon fresh shopper did a good job picking out fresh not old Halos. These are sweet and easy to peal. Would purchase again from Amazon Fresh.,1
"I was really wary about purchasing produce because I prefer to pick it out myself, but I was in a rush, so I took a chance. I am so glad I did. I have purchased these twice so far and I have only found one bruised one. They are so ripe and juicy that it's hard to not just eat them right out of the box!",0
"Wasn’t a fan. When I cooked the salmon, the orange coloring started to drip off, which was strange. Wouldn’t order again",2
love it,0
I love them all.Buying again soon,1
Half had white parts on top - they were not quite ripe yet and were hard/firm.  Most had a tart flavor rather than the more robust sweetness of a riper product.  I will not buy again.,2
"Grew mold in 2 days, but tasted good on day 1",0
Well I love sweet potatoes . Especially the small ones. But this particular batch seem very old and dried out.  I could only eat about 3 of them.  I will but again and hope for a fresher crop!!,1
"I won't be buying these again. Not sure why, but they were not crisp or crunchy. I suspect they were not that fresh.",2
nothing here,0
I never wear earrings until I saw someone post these on tik tok & let me tell you! Super great quality and so cute! I love them!!!!! Can’t wait to order more.,1
By the 2nd day was molding,0
"I've ordered several times, always seems to be picked at proper ripeness. Great flavor, so that makes a good value for me.",0
I bought this twice. First time was excellent second time was horrible!!! NO FLAVOR!!! NOT RIPE!!! MONEY WASTED!! NEVER AGAIN!,2
?!!!!!!!!,0
"When you can't pick your own produce, you get what you get. These may have been the best ones available but not what I would have picked out.",0
"The fish came rotten, fish should basically smell like nothing. Won’t be buying from Amazon fresh again for a long while.",2
So good and fresh!! Will buy more,1
"I was surprised these bananas came well packed and fresh, came a bit on the green side but that’s ok for me, ripped in about 3 days. Will definitely purchase again.",1
"These didn't resemble mandarin oranges, much larger. Only one was edible, the rest were soft and without flavor. I will not purchase again.",2
"The first 2 times we ordered this salmon I would say it was 5-stars all-around except for portion size which was slightly on the small size. We were very satisfied.The past 2 times that we ordered this product the quality seems to have changed. We had to spend 20-minutes removing plastic-like scales that were not removed before packing the fish. This is an inconvenience for sure and one that makes the purchase not worth it. It's pretty gross and they get everywhere - PLEASE SEE ATTACHED PICTURE.In addition to that inconvenience, there is a more ""fishy"" smell inside the package (the first 2 times it was completely odorless).Will not order again.",2
The strawberries were fresh and sweet. would definitely order fresh produce from Amazon Fresh. Thank you!,1
They look and smell so good and fresh,0
"Just got this for the first time today and cooked it tonight. This MOWI salmon is really top notch! My husband is still talking about it tonight. I made a honey glazed salmon meal and it was superb, but the best part was that the salmon was perfect in color and the freshest ever. There was absolutely no odor and it was just a great cut. Only wish the pieces were a little bigger for the price, but I'll definitely be buying it again because of the freshness, the packaging and the taste! MOWI has earned a new customer for life as long as they keep doing it this way.",1
"My dad LOVES clementines, so I try to keep them on hand... but my local grocery store’s selection of these cuties is mediocre, at best.I was SUPER impressed by the freshness, tastiness, and overall quality of these!10/10 will buy again!",1
Comfortable knuckle rings that can fit every finger.  Such a variety and stone colors. Definitely would buy again.,1
"Worth it due to Covid family & I have not been leaving the house and have been in need of fresh fruits & veggies as I am a vegetarian, all i can say is thank you so much Amazon Fresh you guys always deliver with care, fresh food, and notifications when orders are complete This service has saved our family in such a crazy time in the world I appreciate it and will continue to buy and recommend",1
"So I have purchased these a few times, and each time it has been difference. Which I am sure is because of the fruit. But in GENERAL, I will not buy these from here anymore. Sometimes these were just exactly what I hoped for, and sometimes it was just plastic. (Sad face)",2
"These are the most beautiful strawberries I have ever seen in my life!!!!!! Super sweet and I’m usually not a fan of strawberries from Amazon fresh, BUT I was really amazed today! I can’t stop  looking at them!!!! That’s how beautiful they are! I also tasted a few and the taste was outta this world! But please remember........ It’s really a hit or miss with fruits and vegetables on Amazon fresh.",0
"Unlike many, I know exactly what a golden papaya or solo papaya is, and this really is normal size and a reasonable good price for this specific variety of papaya compared to local grocers.However, the last 3 weeks, the papaya has arrived yellow, even to the point of having moldy spots on the skin, but the inside is so hard it actually crunches!The other problem I have is that although I've written several complaints, the papayas are still packed next to cans and arrive bruised and are handled so harshly, the can rims actually cut into and split open the papayas. I keep trying to explain to Amazon, they are like bananas - don't bruise them or crush them! I will buy them again in the future and if they are good, I'll update this review.",1
As rock hard as an avocado can get! Definitely NOT orderin again!,2
"Obvs part of an Fresh order. I usually eat 1 banana a day (take potassium supplement sometimes but in general prefer to ""eat my vitamins"") and tried these out. The quality I got was mixed...I don't mind yellow bananas but 2 were a little overripe. I don't think i've had some bananas ripen so fast(er) overnight. 2 out of the 5 the following morning after delivery were blackened and when open were spoiled (not just slightly browned). I was a bit grossed out but they are acceptable for smoothie making. But...I didn't buy them to make smoothies so the other 3 that were still edible I ate one and while the flavor was good I feel like it was ""juicy"" for a banana.I don't think I'm a fan or this brand or maybe this isn't the right season. I won't be buying bananas from here again. 3 out of 5 for the three that are edible.",2
"It was the smallest lettuce i got from amazon fresh, i hope when I buy next time they send a juicy and big one.",1
The strawberries were very sweet and clean no mold. Very satisfied.,0
I wasn't sure about this fish but it was actually quite fresh. Would order the fish again.,1
So big juicy and sweet,0
These are literally the best tasting strawberries I've ever had.,0
Everything I bought in this order died within a few days. I’ll not be making future purchases here again,2
Ripe and sweet. Perfect,0
"Sometimes YES, sometimes NO.  It's the end of December on the east coast and Halos are a definite NOOOOOO!  They arrived spoiled, pitted, mushy and mostly inedible.  I will wait till spring then order again.",1
The strawberries were so large! These stayed fresh for a couple of weeks! Excellent flavor and very reasonably priced.,0
"these were so good that I decided I'll purchase again. I got some at costco for a better price, but these tasted better.",1
Nice and fresh,0
"Always juicy, never bruised or moldy. Will buy again!",1
great strawberries very fresh great taste,0
"They were  great!I love sautéed mushrooms in garlic oil!Dash of  sea salt!The  has such great flavor .Will buy them again, it’s worth it!",1
"Might be why they are discounted right now, received refund but it didn't even arrive cold, it was warm at best not even packaged in their ""cool kept bags"" that I've received in the past... either drivers need trained on how to store cold items or they need to add that option for drivers after delivery... but also its just a waste of food. I have had semi good fruits and veggies delivered by fresh especially during Quarantine but it seems lately quality is going downhill.",0
"This is the worst bag of mandarins I have ever had in my entire life. They are tiny, smaller than a ping pong ball, and way underripe. Impossible to peel. I will not purchase again.",2
These are delicious and the bag comes with a lot! Definitely buying again.,1
This was my first time ordering food on Amazon and strawberries were bad the bottom portion were bruised and rotten I probably won’t buy fruit from them again but the non-perishable items were all perfectly fine. They arrive quickly it’s just said the fruit was no good at all nothing that you would take personally to take home so I don’t know why they would pick it up,2
My bananas were brown and mushy. I was so disappointed because in the past they've been great. I wasted money this time.  Now I won't order fruit from Amazon Fresh again because the shopper didn't mind bagging rotten food.,2
"Took about 4 or 5 days to turn from green to yellow. When they ripened, they were the most delicious bananas ever. Have you ever bought bananas from a grocery store, and they tasted funky? These are are sweetest, best bananas ever. I will order a bunch every time I order.",1
These are very good berries!! It is so wonderful to be eating so healthy food from Whole Foods with just a click of a button!,0
"My first Golden Papayas order on Fresh, so I only buy 1 when it's discountedI weight it, 34 oz ---great sizetaste: sweet  but not super sweet--- very goodFresh: yes, ---- greatprice: I buy it when it's less than $2, later price increase to $4 (I don't think I'll buy it again at $4)----great with discount, not too worth without discount.",2
Unusable. Never ordering papaya from Amazon again. They're overpriced and picked too young so they're not sweet.,2
"About 90% of the strawberries were good, but 10% were too moldy and had to be thrown away.",0
"Not as described. I had ordered the ""CUTIES"" from Amazon Fresh and was pleased. These are NOT the same item that is delivered; they are NOT SUNKIST, and are NOT even the same kind of citrus, which are smaller, and sweeter. My son still likes them, and I weighed them on a kitchen scale, and the weight was a bit over 3 lbs. So I will buy them again, but begrudgingly, because of the price and false advertising, as it's the only fresh fruit my son will eat. Otherwise, Ill pass, as I'm not a fan; I prefer the ""CUTIES.""",1
"Not as much crispness or flavor as regular cucumbers. Pretty bland, actually. Will not buy again.",2
"I don’t know what kind of avocado this is but it went straight to garbage. The other produce I receive is as bad. Will not buy from Amazon fresh again, I thought I would try it but was disappointed. The dry items are ok. Delivery time is good.",2
"Even in a brick and morter, I expect to have a few bad berries.  Not one and the rest were just right, some a little green but did not impact the taste, Like I said I was shocked,  Very good",0
They where either over ripe or not good quality or left out before they arrived: they ruined a few days after arrival I had to throw almost half of them out.,0
"My children LOVE smoothies and fresh fruit. I LOVE getting all of our fruit from Amazon Fresh! Everything is fresh, healthy, and the best quality around, ALWAYS!!!",0
super fresh. great taste will be buying again.,1
These were very good!,0
The bag of sweet potatoes were fresh. I look forward to all the ways to cook my potatoes. I did some roasted potatoes and veggies. It was so delicious that I almost didn't want to leave any leftovers  Will try sweet potatoes fries soon. May have to peel and freeze the rest so that they don't go bad. Great buy. I will buy again.,1
These are NOT Halos!!! Fresh has been out of Halos for a while so I decided to give these a shot. The first slice was so sour I almost spit it out. The second was not any better. Very disappointed. Will not be buying these again!,2
I used to love ordering these but the past three orders have been so bad. This was my last time ordering watermelon on Amazon Fresh,2
Love these! I will be ordering another set.,1
"So good, fresh full of flavor and worth the money!",0
Fresh fruit is always 5 star,0
I have ordered this item on four separate occasions and each time have gotten a rock hard avocado that took days to ripen.  Shouldn't be sold as ready to eat. I will not order anymore,2
"I love ordering amazon fresh but this is the 3rd time I receive smashed bananas, wanted to give benefit of the doubt to my first bad experience thinking it could have been bad luck... 2nd time I told myself I was not buying again... 3rd time I forgot to delete from cart. I won’t forget not to buy again",2
No flavor or sweetness,0
Always has mold on it . Have to sort through pack every time . Sometimes we get lucky and get to keep 1/2 the pack . I won't order again,2
Very fresh bought extra to freeze for smothies.,0
"They looks classy, not heavy, comfortable to wear. Will definitely buy again",1
IT WAS REALLY FRESH and some came sweet flavor!,0
"They were fresh, plump and was so sweet...",0
Sweet & fresh,0
In my order I included  3 avocados and I thought will receive medium avocados not this size! For $1.39 each one??? Really?? Very disappointed was my first and last order!!,2
"The first time I bought strawberries from amazon they were amazing! But these past 2 weeks they have all been bruised, slimy, and became moldy within 2 days....totally inedible which is a bummer and I’m not going to buy again for awhile. ",2
Chunks of the melon were almost crunchy.  Not the desired texture for cantaloupe.  Would not buy again.,2
"I'm not happy with this purchase. I don't understand why they would sell spoiled items.  Not ""fresh"" at all. It seem like lately I've been getting spoiled food. I will no longer buy fresh produce here again.",2
I would buy again because they were perfect.  Too bad I cant get another delivery date.,1
"First time purchaser. Read the review prior to the purchase. I was very nervous as I am kind person like to pick up mine own groceries. It turns out perfect! I bought one ready to eat, one not ready yet to compare. The skin of ready to eat looks really sad, but it was perfect inside. Love it! Will definitely purchase again.",1
The day I got the strawberries they looked good. The next morning I took them out of the fridge to eat with my cereal. There was already mold growing on them. I’ve never had that happen so fast before. I saved what I could. I used them on cereal and ice cream after I mashed them up and added some sugar to them. They lasted longer that way. I won’t buy them  anymore.,2
No comparison in the taste. I always pick a box when I get chance.,0
"These cucumbers seemed ideal for some quick pickles or a crisp addition to my salads.  I have ordered them 3 times, hope springs eternal.  Each time the cucumbers appeared fine on arrival, but they were a bit limp and if I didn't use them all within the fist 48 hours they became mush in the refrigerator and I had to get rid of them.  I won't be ordering again.",2
This was such a delicious product!  I will purchase it again from Whole Foods using my Amazon Prime Account.,1
The title speaks for itself. Didn’t get to enjoy them. They were molded once after 1 day.,0
They turned bad in 3 days????,0
These did not ripen well. 10% around the stem remained green. Too early in the season I suppose.,0
Love this! FRESH! Great will purchase every week! Thanks 5 stars definitely!,1
Not sweet. Also not as juicy as those purchased in the store. Won't reorder.,2
Gross. It's hard. Taste like the rind and not watermelon. Never again.,2
They were just about the best strawberries I ever had! Delivered for free in less than 2 hours. I'm amazed by Amazon! Just love being a prime member. One of the best value for your money deal around.,0
"Not sure why this watermelon tasted off, but I wouldn't order again.",2
Got moldy within a day! Never ordering again.,2
Very tasty,0
"These were so slimy, and they were either too ripe or so hard I immediately asked for a refund when I tried one and surveyed the rest. I will never buy this again after this experience--not worth the money or risk.",2
"I eat Salmon all the time and always buy fresh. There is something weird about fresh salmon that has a shelf life of 3 weeks. Even if it is vacuum sealed... When I opened it, it had a smell like faint formaldehyde? I’ve never experienced anything like it. Cooked up well but was virtually tasteless. I usually love the flavor of salmon and this did not taste like the fish that it is! I only ate the first piece. Just gives me a weird feeling all around for some reason. I don’t plan on purchasing again...",2
The variety of rings is amazing! Stylish & comfortable. I'd definitely re buy.,1
Will buy again,1
"I don't think they even try to pick out good fruit. Almost every single time I've ordered peaches or plums, they are hard as a rock, unripe, bitter and inedible. Never again.",2
I wasn't thrilled with these peaches. I ordered 2 and one had a rather obvious rotton spot on it. The other one looks like it was one of the last ones there and had been picked over.I will not buy again.,2
Great thick pieces and once I seasoned fried and put in the oven it was fantastic with some rice. Will buy again,1
This never ripened and then just started to rot. Had to throw away. Won’t buy again,2
"Beautiful and fresh! I’m always a little worried ordering fresh produce from Amazon, but I’ve been pleasantly surprised. (I guess it really depends on the location. I’m in San Diego)",0
"Oh yes, these are good. I've had some pretty iffy fish fromAmazon, but these are just perfect. I will buy one every week now. Delicious!",1
Berries not ripe,0
The strawberries were fresh and tasted delicious! I was surprised that I did not find  not one bad strawberry. All strawberries were bright red.,0
Old and no fresh why?money back please,0
definitely order again,1
Very juicy and fresh.  It they can engineer a seedless variety I’d be extra happy.  I’ll buy again.  No reservations and it tasted great!,1
"These halos came bad and soft, not ordering these type of things on Amazon again",2
Great value! I ordered quickly and was stunned by the amount of rings I received. Way more than I expected! Pack includes 3+ sizes so you can stack or combine in so many ways. Also Great if you are unsure of ring size. I will buy again,1
Shocked at how delicious and FRESH every single strawberry was.,0
"What a disappointment!!  Chewy, no salmon flavor.  Won’t buy this again!Used to buy MOWI salmon all the time, now it’s only this house brand.",2
"Each orange is a little smaller than I expected, but they are still large enough to pair with something else for breakfast. The flavor and freshness are fantastic. I wish the bag/netting did not create so much of a mess when cut with scissors, but this is a very minor complaint. I will likely purchase again.",1
Fresh and ripe great buy,0
Arrives spoiled and molds the next day or two,0
These grapefruit are AMAZING!!!!!! They are hugh and very flavorful. I will order these again,1
Going bad after 2 days,0
Tasty,0
"Although the produce arrived edible, the oranges have seeds unlike the description.  My daughter freaks out at seeds.  The fruit was also sweating and wet, so that will likely shorten the life of the fruits.  My fault for ordering online. I would never order again",2
I took a chance ordering this based on all the reviews. I had to wait for 2 days for my avocado to ripen. I will probably not buy again. When I pay $3 for a ready to eat avocado I kind of want one that I can eat right away.,2
These earrings very pretty and broke after 1 wear. Would not recommend and wouldn’t buy again. Only one set is still in tact.,2
Flavor of Amazon fresh fruits are always fresh.,0
"Super fresh, no artificial flavors whatsoever. Perfect mango. Will definitely be ordering again.",1
Loved the different styles and sizes.  I would buy these again,1
Fair price and they arrived without too much bruising. Good value for the money!,0
Fresh strawberries were past their prime and some were mushy.,0
"My strawberries  A total of 16-18 ct were juicy, delicious and fresh, and some had big one's. This was my first time buying on Amazon Fresh.  I took my chances despite the bad reviews from 2016. I'm sure there have been some good strawberries. Now it's 2020, stores make improvements, give them a try.",0
"So this is the second set of earrings I bought. The first was for my daughter and they are beautiful.  She wears them all the time and so far they have stayed as pretty as the day they came. I bought the second set for my sister because she loved them so much. For the price, they are fantastic. The backs and posts are sturdy and the metal they use hasn’t cause any reactions.  That is a big deal since my daughter has very sensitive skin. Overall extremely happy with my purchase. I will most likely buy other products from this vendor",1
Fresh and juicy. Ripe and ready to eat.  Great flavor.  Not smashed or rotten berries. Great way to get your vitamins.,0
Horrible. Overpriced will not buy again,2
No no no. These strawberries are so moldy. This isn't the first time. It's actually the 6th. I keep buying them thinking it will be better next time but NO they are the same. Really so disappointed that Amazon would continue selling them. The good strawberries on here are over $6 & over priced. So maybe that's why I keep running too these cheap ones. NEVER AGAIN,2
Do not buy!!!! This has to be the 4th time I received this at the end of its cycle. It is tasteless not fresh and has seeds. I will never buy this product again. Save yourself and your money. It didn’t even last 3 days til it expired smh,2
"I divided this salmon into three portions. Each time I ate it, I had a lingering woody, bitter aftertaste in my mouth for several hours (4+). Some might not mind, but I found it very unpleasant.Aftertaste aside, the cut of salmon seemed fresh and was quite enjoyable. I'd buy from this brand again, but in my opinion, skip the cedar.",1
Next time I will take a picture but I was able yo say the rest,0
"This is some good quality salmon. I usually buy salmon frozen and individually wrapped in the bag (bad, I know..lol). But once I had a taste of this fresh packed salmon, there was no turning back! I will definitely order more!",1
"I usually buy the MOWI brand of Salmon and never had a problem. This Amazon brand was disappointing. It smelled fishy, even though the expiration date was 2 weeks away. It was also boney. Maybe the portions are 6 ounces each, but they were very thin. Won't buy their brand again.",2
"Some Amazon Fresh products are hit or miss. The mushrooms were fresh every time I ordered. Also, the taste is great.Will keep ordering.",1
Good strawberries,0
I got these for my daughter for her birthday and she loved them.  She can mix and match them and she always has one on because there are so many.  I'd purchase these again as a gift.,1
"So, compared to HALO these are pure junk,  crap. They are small,  hard to peel,  unusual flavor, and weird texture. I'll never buy these again from Fresh.",2
Having a hard time with all my blueberry orders as they are never sweet and am not going to order again.  Every time I get an order they get bitter and more bitter the next time.  Not even sugar helps!,2
"It's hard to have someone else pick out your fruit.  The person who picked this one did an OK job, it was just not ripe enough. I would purchase this way, again...",1
Refreshing. I will order again,1
These strawberries look and smell delightful!  I could smell them when I opened the bag.  The perfect freshness!  Nice and red and ripe but would definitely hold for a day or two!  <where'd I put that whipped cteam?>  hahaha!,0
"I REALLY REALLY REALLY like these rings! Yes, they are all randomly sized, but who cares lol. The rings that were a little larger than my finger, I took a pair of jewelry pliers and snipped the back to fit me better. I’m definitely buying more, thanks for this product, I appreciate you!",1
"I have ordered this product a few times and probably will order again as I haven’t gotten sick yet. This product might come with some discoloration, either dark spots on the body of the strawberry and/or white spots at the top. They try to fit 1 pound of strawberries in a tiny container and I have had the product arrive open inside the fresh bag. This product tastes much better than it looks. Definitely needs a wash before you eat them, you can just see the dirt coming off in a bowl. I usually eat these with whipped cream",1
"Compared to Quties bought at the supermarket, this brand is not as good.  It's almost impossible to peel by hand without gouging, and some of the items went bad rather quickly (again, compared with what I'm accustomed to buying at the store).  I've tried it twice, and don't think I'll order it again.",2
Taste wasn't good used as snack,0
"I ordered these yesterday and when they arrived they were beautiful.  Today, My daughter started slicing them up and they were all rotten inside.  I contacted Amazon and received a refund.  I have ordered other items with no problem, I think I will refrain from buying them again.",2
Sweet good taste and fresh. Definitely buying more,1
"I have purchased this mango twice. The first time it was sour and hard as a rock, and I assumed it was a fluke. The second time the pieces were even more green. I got a little out of the first pack, but this one I had to toss it all. I won't be purchasing this again",2
"I read reviews on this salmon and hesitated, however I'd like to say I was pleasantly satisfied. Bake as instructed on packaging and it will be perfect! Definitely ordering again.",1
"If I inspected these at any grocery store, I would have purchased, but this is now the third time in a row that I have received several strawberries growing mold. On this recent batch, the strawberries looked spectacular, but while rinsing (within 15 minutes of my order delivery), I found the moldy strawberries in the middle of the batch. Really disappointed. I was able to salvage only 2/3 of the batch. For the price we pay, unacceptable. —Miami, FL",0
Really good,0
"The strawberries would be perfect now for strawberry shortcake, they are that good!",0
Can in fresh and cold will be ordering again,1
"These berries were sweet, firm and tasty. I will buy more ",1
"Wasn't ripe, totally crunchy and flavorless!!!!Won't buy again eeeewwwww",2
First Time I ordered I received a really good quality avocado. But Second time I just waist my money!! Really disappointed!! I received something that I dont think should be able to purchase again! It was ruin!,2
"We bought bananas from Amazon Fresh over and over again. Every single one of them tasted horrible. I thought maybe it's just a bad batch, but I was proven wrong. Even my husband who is not a picky eater now bans me from buying bananas (or any fruits other than Fuji Apple) from Amazon. The outside looks ripe, the inside looks ripe, the texture is of ripe bananas,  but somehow the taste is a taste of unripe banana. We tried eating it at different levels of ripeness, but nope. It just tastes bad. Never again!",2
Never again ☹️☹️,2
This were the most fresh juiciest strawberries I have eaten I never can get them like this at any store.,0
"I’ve ordered strawberries quite a few times through AmazonFresh, always hopeful, but knowing it’s a 50/50 toss up if they’ll be okay or rotten...and truly, 50/50 is being kind. Figuring I’d be safe in the height of summer, and *really* wanting some strawberries, I tried again. But no...over a 1/4 of the package was rotten, another 1/2 was so mushy that my fingers slipped completely into the strawberry while trying to take them out to throw away, and in the end, out of a full pound - I was left with eight strawberries that didn’t look like they’d give me food poisoning if I ate them. SAD.",0
Strawberry,0
package weight must include the weight of the cedar plank because the fish portions seemed smaller.  would not buy again. (cooked in a toaster oven like usual.  flavor was fine),2
It’s either not ripe or i have to eat it the same day because it’s going bad.,0
First time I ordered and wasn't fresh or sweet. Might not order in the future,2
"These are the best strawberries I've ever bought - the tase is sweet and floral, the look is uniform and perfectly ripe.",0
"Disgusting.  All were rotten and completely inedible.  They all had spots on the outside and moldy stems.  Upon opening, each pomegranate was black and moldy on the inside. The bags in which they were shipped were worth more than the actual fruit.  Won't be buying from Amazon Fresh again.  They wouldn't send me replacements.",2
Very fresh and sweet. Kids loves them!,0
Salad,0
I bought this for around 5bucks but the oranges were spoiled. I don't think I'll buy this again,2
"I regret not getting a picture but they really aren’t kidding when they say “mini”. I guess it probably depends on the shipment they received. I guess this batch was just extraordinarily small. Since I don’t have a picture, I’d compare their size to that of a q-tip. I used to buy these from the market back before this pandemic happened so I know how large these can get (which isn’t that big). But these were just so scrawny I actually laughed when I got them. They still tasted quite nice though so no problem there. I would buy it again since it’s convenient but, that’s really the only reason why.",1
I have always love amazonfresh. Its very convenient and products are always fresh. This time however my papaya was delivered to me rotten. Definitely won't be ordering any papayas from here again.,2
I ordered 2 and had to take a second mortgage on my house. It was very tasty and I will definitely be saving so I can buy another one,1
"great quality, fresh, we are ordering more soon",1
VERY GOOD,0
Excellent,0
"Wow......strong flavor, great for cooking, definitely buying a larger size of this!",1
"gooey, disgusting and they smell!!",0
These delicious fruits were used for smoothies and just eating plain. They were very refreshing.,0
"Moldy, rotten, and dripping in the bag. There's NO WAY the person picking didn't see that and there is NO WAY the produce manager didn't see their produce was rotten and moldy and there's NO WAY I'm spending  hard earned money on rotten food from WF. ""On sale"" 2 for $5. Guess I know why. WF's prices aren't any better than anywhere else AND neither is their quality. Everybody does curbside and delivery. If they want sales they are going to have to do better with the quality. No one is going to spend money on ROTTEN FOOD. That's one slimy move trying to unload rotten food.",0
This is about my third time trying to order a decent yellow pineapple but no good. Second time was eatable but this third time. It wasn’t ripe so I let it sit out for two day and immediately there was a scent so I decided to cut it open in which it was white and smelled and tastes bad. The first time there were maggots coming from it only after sitting for two days. Never will I buy it again.,2
Very tart and sour; small and seedy and they started to go bad after three days! I ended up blending them with other stuff so I found a use but I hate not picking out my own produce....,0
"We've ordered these strawberries a few times. Sometimes they are sweet and tasty. Sometimes many of them are bruised and mushy. Sometimes, most of them are dry and tasteless. No way to tell what you are going to get.",0
I bought several times.  3 or 4 each purchase.  The last purchase had a bad taste.  I bought 3 of them and they tasted like perfume or something had spilled in them.  They smelled peculiar as well. So I had to throw them away.  I won't buy it from here anymore.  I can't keep throwing away money like that.,2
"I don’t usually write reviews on products, but these earrings I’ve had for a couple months are amazing. They don’t rust at all and I’ve had that in the  past. They also include extra backings gold and plastic and I love that. Definitely recommend this product , has different style of earrings these are my go too rather it small ones for the gym or little bigger ones for the night out. Very happy with this purchase. Will buy again. :)",1
I was a bit skeptical about buying strawberries on here so I just gave it a chance and I’ve bought strawberries twice on here. I’ve received them in good condition :),0
"Excelente sabor ,llegaron frescas.",0
I was excited untill i opened ot and tasted it. Not sweet bit bland and i won't ever buy it again. Maybe it wasnt riped,2
"Twice in a row with a week or more between orders, the strawberries were delivered with mold on them. Won't order this item again.",2
"Never thought ording spinach, Fresh, online would work, but it did.  It was delicious and worked well in our salads.  I also make green shakes with it. I will order again now I see how easy it was.",1
Me encanta,0
Always fresh and they are great in size. Perfect for our chocolate covered strawberries.,0
What am I supposed to do with dark green bananas? what I ordered should be yellow according to photo and previous orders. I guess I won't be ordering bananas from Amazon anymore,2
Fresh and juicy,0
It not fresh at all,0
"My last two orders, the cantaloupe was spoilt when cutting  it one day after receiving. I  am not buying again.",2
"I’m not sure what happened here, but I cooked this to 127 degrees like all of the other salmon I eat, and it tasted extremely fishy and hard on the outside. I wonder if this has anything to do with the fish coming to me half-frozen and me cooking it immediately for dinner. Regardless, not getting this again.",2
Time I order avocados from fresh direct they always turn up OK and then within hours they turn black and they’re dead so I’m not gonna be ordering avocados from fresh direct any more,2
Most of them were the size of a hot dog. Wouldn’t buy again.,2
"Very fresh and firm strawberries.  No bruises, no mold present.  Tasted woderful",0
"I ordered these mandarins for the first time and they were fresh and tasty. When I ordered a second time, my disappointment knew no bounds. More than half was rotten! They had to be thrown away. I don't know how they review before shipping, but it's terrible. I will not order again.",2
Taste normal and very fresh lasted quite a while in fridge covered by Debbie Myers wrap. Fair price kinda. Would buy again,1
Came rotten! Going back to buying outrageously priced oranges for my citrus cravings !Most likely not going to order again!,2
Strawberries are large juicy and pretty to look at but aren't quite ripe enough and very little flavor. I don't get them anymore as they have been a disappointment several different times,0
My strawberries were not very well picked. They were bruised and decaying which was very disappointing,0
"I have buying bell peppers from Amazon Fresh for years with never a problem that I can recall, but the last few times they have been getting smaller and smaller and even have had weird shapes. I guess i won't be buying them anymore, i'll just stick to picking them myself from an actual grocery store.",2
"the grapes were firm, but turning brown.  this was immediately on delivery.  sour taste.  definitely not something I would buy again.",2
This is a good product and would keep buying this as long as Amazon supplies it.,1
"I purchased these on a whim wanting some fairly cheap strawberries and was so pleased. The strawberries I reviewed were huge, picturesque looking, fresh, and delicious! I will definitely buy again.",1
Tasty,0
Perhaps would never purchase produce from Fresh again,2
They were fresh. I will definitely order again.,1
I very much dislike not being able to pick my own produce but I gave it a try this time around and was very disappointed for my first order of these. Immediately upon opening there was a very obviously moldy strawberry. I will not be ordering ever again! I will stick to my instinct of going to the store to pick my own produce.,2
They were not as fresh as expected had to throw some out,0
"Well… what can I say??? I bought 2 of these. One piece tasted fresh, but the other piece didn’t smell so fresh and it didn’t taste so fresh either. It had a bit of a sour taste after cooking it too. So I don’t know what happened there. These are usually fresh. I won’t be buying this one anymore. I’ll stick to the other one. I thought I’d try these cos they were out of the regular ones. Oh well… love snd learn.",2
I would purchase again,1
"I understand perfectly when a product is about to expire it should go on sale, it's a business, but even with discount, that isn't right. I know I won't get a super fresh strawberrie but i don't want to get rotten fruit",0
"Looked thoroughly expired and grey, worried I may have gotten food poisoning from the bite I took, only bought because mowi was out of stock for what I usually by, will never buy Amazon brand salmon again.",2
I ate this salmon a few times and everything was fine now lately it makes me sick to my stomach. I won't be buying this product again.,2
"i would not serve them to a monkey, certainly not my family. I am done with this store! Never again!",2
will purchase again,1
I'd say:55% of the time they're ripe and the flavor is amazing30% they're ripe not a lot of flavors10% they're not ripe/no flavors5% they're in bad conditionOverall: safe to order,0
Wrong time if the year to expect great flavor but at least they weren’t rotten,0
Strawberries  are over ripe and some are already bad.,0
Juicy and sweet with a like bit of tangy. I enjoyed. I will keep buying,1
The strawberries were a really nice size which I appreciate. They didn't last long though and they weren't really flavorful or juicy but they were ripe and tasted okay. I think it's probably best to pick my own fruit.,0
Could be better,0
Salad or dessert,0
is the only way to describe these avocados. The first time I ordered 4 and they were a black almost to the pit inside. Second time ordered two. Same thing. Never again.,2
"I am not normally one for Farm Raised Fish, however, we are in the middle of a pandemic, and this was all I can get. Considering, this was pretty good. I like the fact they were fresh and not frozen. May buy again, until I can get back to the store.",1
Would not ripen. Even after 2-3 weeks. Never again.,2
"I tried to like this salmon, but then learned they INJECT IT WITH PINK DYE to make it look edible. I used to have a vehicle but was car jacked at gunpoint, so I'm having to order my groceries online. Salmon is my favorite fish to prepare at home, but sadly every single fish I've bought from Fresh has been close to HORRIBLE.PLEASE FRESH, up your game with your fresh fish, or I'm never ordering it again, believe that.",2
"Spinach leaves are consistent medium-sized and fresh. I hate when I buy a bag of spinach and the some leaves are too big, some small. Would buy again.",1
Flavor is excellent. Would like to buy larger portions. I look for sale prices and buy it when it’s on sale.,1
These are a family favorite so I'll buy them often,1
Everytime I order these and they are taped together they appear fine. Green and lovely. The next day they are all soft on the curved back. The first time I chalked it up because it was just on banana that had the mushy back after a day. Well may last order EVERY SINGLE ONE had a bruised and mushy back. And I have a picky toddler so you already know shes not going for that and neither am I. As much as we love Bananas I won't be ordering them from here anymore. Produce is iffy with this service so buyers expect the worse because 50% of the time you'll get that,2
You could smell the strawberry smell when unpacking them. Firm and not at all over ripe. A little tart for strawberries though. Will order more.,1
"I love spinach leaves but I soon realized that when I received these, they were about to expire. I may not purchase my spinach leaves here again to avoid this reoccurring issue. The packaging was done well, so no complaints about that. My 3-star rating was due to the item received about to expire about 3 days after I received it.",2
They were frozen and flavor was not very good had to add sugar and freeze to enjoy them,0
"Gorgeous earrings! Definitely recommend, and would buy again. And also received some hair ties in the package lovely detail!",1
Not sure where the filet was from. The color is somewhat 'not fresh'. Will not buy again.,2
"Never had more sower and tasteless strawberries, no taste at all, not even a bit sweet",0
"I usually buy ""disposable"" fashion rings from H&M for $9.99 per pack of 5. This 82 pack of rings is an excellent deal. I don't wear knuckle rings and some of the rings in this pack are too small for even my pinky. But that's ok because MOST of the rings are regular sizes - 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. These rings are even more substantial than the H&M rings, which are flimsy and turn color quickly. There are many cute designs and stones on these rings, and they aren't all ""vintage"" looking (I grew up in the 70's). Many look up to date and very cute.  I will definitely purchase a pack of the other styles.",1
"Salad, but everytime I order mushrooms from you they are brown and look old, not like pictures you show, will not order again I gave you 4 chances and again today's are bad",2
"Any precut fruit is pricey, no different here, but sometimes I think it's worth the price when time is not on my side.The first day I knew this would turn quickly if not eaten. Every piece was soft, not wilted or mushy, but soft. I prefer firm fruit but this had nice flavor.It was only me eating it so day three I had to toss it unfortunately. I was only able to eat maybe half of the fruit so it's definitely not good value money wise.I've tried other precut fruit from Amazon Fresh and it's the amount thing. So I won't be making any purchase anymore.",2
They are the Driscoll brand you can find in the regular store. Some where ripe and others were not. It is always hit or miss with fruit. This batch was not the greatest but have gotten excellent berries from this brand.,0
Watermelon should not crunch. The watermelon isn’t that sweet. They cut the watermelon to soon. I guess from reading the other reviews there were complaints of over ripe/ going bad . Won’t be buyng again . Don’t know how to go about refund,2
"I order this alll the time and I’ve never realized the bad reviews till now.. they are a bit old (4+ years) so to give a update every time I have order (over 6 times) my salmon is always in good shape , no worms & never made me sick nor my family of 5 . We eat this a lot and never had an issue. Smells fine never any nasty off smell. My meals always come out amazing. I’ll be buying just like I have. I always had one to my order even the big filet . Give it a try",1
"I have ordered these many times. They were always fabulous until the last two times that I ordered.  The last two times, they were turning bad.",0
I will definitely buy again... SO FRESH!!,1
"When I opened the Amazon Fresh box containing these strawberries I was taken by the aroma. The box of strawberries was the only thing in this particular box and they were in there long enough to fill it with the perfect strawberry smell. Each strawberry was in good condition. They varied in size from medium to large. What made these stand out from average supermarket strawberries is that there was not a single rotten piece of fruit. I sliced them up and sprinkled a little sugar on them to bring out the flavor and then a bit of cool whip. Superb. I have continued to have a very similar experience with each box over the past 3 weeks. I highly recommend them. If you have found this review helpful, please click on the tab below",0
I don't think I'm ever going to order fresh produce from Amazon fresh again because all the vegetables and fruits I receive are only good for 1 or 2 days and are not fresh at all. Definitely don't recommend ordering fruits and veggies because they always send me either the smallest and or not fresh items.,2
They always taste fresh and crunchy! will keep on ordering these while its in season!,1
Excellent product and great price. High quality and fast shipping!,0
"This was my first time order anything using Amazon fresh, so naturally I was nervous about ordering these strawberries, due to some of the reviews. I must say, I am VERY pleased with not only the condition and taste of the fresh strawberries that were timely delivered to me, but also the service. My infant daughter loves the strawberries and so do I!  A+ Amazon Fresh and thank you for making my first online grocery shopping experience a great one!",0
Had to throw away the strawberries because they were moldy.,0
Never buying oranges from amazon fresh again.,2
Most of the strawberries were old and rotten. The few that were edible had a horrible chemical taste even after a thorough washing. It was not the brand of strawberries as this is a brand I have bought elsewhere and they have been perfectly fine. I am unsure how Amazon stores their produce but I am hesitant about purchasing any further produce from Amazon after receiving this item.  I definitely will never order strawberries again.,2
Fresh and thick,0
Delicious flavored strawberries. I love strawberries and have bought this product a few times with my last amazon fresh orders but have had trouble with the freshness each time. I’m just sure to wash the fruit and pick out the bad ones.,0
"Definitely not fresh ... after a few days they were slimy, kept them around to see what would happen, after 5 days they were growing mold. GROSS. Will never order again.",2
They were actually much fresher than the ones I buy at nearby shop rite. Very happy with this purchase.,0
I’m waiting to get Popeyes up on this motha. Still hasn’t happened but I will buy tt again and try,1
"Fresh, delicious and no sugar needed!",0
Love strawberries:Pro:RomanticLove fresh cut upLove with sugerLove with whipLove with my wifeLove them periodCon:Seasonal and not year round,0
Not exactly sweet enough for me though.,0
free delivery keeps exposure to virus to minimum as good as product from local store,0
Fresh fruit and very sweet.,0
"The watermelon was not fresh at all. The smell was so bad, I will not order it again.",2
I had ordered these strawberries before and they were fine.  This time at least half were going bad or rotten.  Does Amazon have any form of quality control???!So Disappointed.,0
"I was a little concerned by the older bad reviews but thought I’d take a chance. This salmon was very, very fresh and very delicious. The portion size was just right. I will definitely be buying this again.",1
As I said before this salmon is great the taste is great it’s not smelly it’s always fresh it comes with the right size portions so i would order again!,1
Very best strawberries I have had in a long time. Wish I had gotten 2 packages,0
not what I was expecting. they were cut it from green mangos. the flavor was not good. will not buy it again.,2
"This was my first time  ordering this item I was kind of skeptical however I was impressed when I received it,, strawberries was very sweet and fresh,  maybe two bad strawberries out the entire bunch. Will order again",1
"Ordered 2 lbs of these strawberries for the 3rd time. My last order I got about a pound out of the 2 lbs. Never, thought anything about it. Just thought I got a bad 1 lb basket. Well, this time it was worse! Mold, Mold, Mold! Can, these packers not see that they are molded when they are grabbing them. Because I could absolutely see that there was green/white furry mold immediately. On at least 2 in the basket, until I opened it and they were all bad. I got 9 strawberries out of 2 pounds that were even remotely edible and only after having to cut away the bad. Not Happy Amazon Fresh!! Not buying again!",2
Amazing flavor and awesome aroma! Can't ask for better.,0
"I ordered three peaches to try peaches from Amazon Fresh. I have ordered apples, bananas, blueberries, and other fruit with great results. However, these peaches arrived hard as rocks. I tried to eat one and it was more crunchy than an apple, plus it had zero flavor. I decided to let the other two ripen on the counter for a day or two. When I picked up the next peach two days later it was brown and mushy. I ended up tossing both. Absolutely will NOT buy peaches from Amazon Fresh again.",2
"Goes from 4 to 5 days green to brown, Not good.. I’ll not buy this brand again.",2
This is very sweet and delicious,0
Cut open my bell pepper and found a bug inside alive and well.  PLEASE BE AWARE!!!!!!!!!. I called and reported this issue so AMAZON can check their produce. I will not be buying product ANY LONGER.,2
They had a very good taste.  They had good color and flavor.,0
"THEY ARRIVED BRUISED, SOFT, AND MOST WERE ROTTEN.  NEVER AGAIN!!",2
"if you are lucky you will get a fresh box, and then you will love them. Last time wasnt so good so Its a matter of luck.",0
I’ve bought this before and it was great. The recent purchase got me moldy strawberries and it was quite disappointing!,0
It was not sweet enough it was like biting into a lemon.,0
"They only lasted two days, they molded really quick, but they were great tasting and nice and fresh upon arrival",0
Seems small amount for price,0
"I was surprised at how well this salmon turned out. I made in it an Air Fryer with just a few seasonings. The fish was really good, had a great taste. Portion size good for two people, will buy again.",1
Very good strawberries,0
"Strawberries are scarce in Minnesota in late December. I typically do not buy then unless they are organic and look really fresh. There were no organic ones available, and I needed them to garnish a Christmas Eve charcuterie platter, so I bought this small package with the stems still attached. They were expensive but they were large, fresh, and tasted like they were perfectly ripe and perfectly fresh. Yummy!",0
"I bought strawberries from Amazon multiple times. Each time they never failed to impress me on how big the strawberries are. They are not only big but pretty tasty especially on a hot day.Freshness:The couple times that I bought strawberries they were always fresh. There were no signs of molding and had a fresh strawberry smell when I opened the box up.Sweetness:This varies quite a bit, but they weren't really sweet when I received my batch. It wasn't sour either though which is exactly how I like mine. It would have been nice if it was a little sweeter but definitely not a deal breaker.Price:While the price is higher than my local supermarket for a smaller portion but I would say the quality for these are worth the higher pricer point. I get more at the super market and it's cheaper, but some of the strawberries that I received were already starting to rot. This was also with being able to choose my strawberries.Overall, I enjoy these strawberries and would buy again.",1
A few of the pieces were very under ripe which sucked and one piece was pretty much mush and tasted slightly rotten.  A bit disappointing when having a mango craving. i'll  buy it again I hope I get pieces that are better in ripeness and no mushy-going-bad bits.,1
I’m happy with the spinach and would buy again.,1
Thank you. Will order more,1
"Not sure if it’s just the batch we got, but these were hard and had me and my whole household questioning if they were even mangoes. Definitely won’t buy again.",2
The last batch arrived Moldy.  Gross.  Very disappointed in the LACK of quality control.,0
Great,0
will never buy again!,2
"Average quality, fast delivery. Good buy!",0
They are very fresh and well packaged! would buy again!,1
"Arrived unripe, green, and  inedible. Last one I left to ripen for 5 days it got too soft but not sweet. This time I left it for 3 days it stays hard and not sweet at all. I throw it in the trash and promised myself to never order cantaloupe melon again",2
YUMMY!  I will definitely buy this again!,1
5 star will buy again,1
These are amazing earrings and the company sent the earrings in individual bags and a zipped product bag with plenty of extra earring backings. The earrings are great quality for the price you get them for. Would definitely buy again!,1
"These usually are nice and juicy and delicious, but the last order we got, they were well past their date of goodness. I Will buy again soon",1
Mealy. Waste of money. Wouldn't order again,2
This is a really great value and it comes with so many cute anklets. The gold looks very nice and they have a nice feel to them. The dangle charms on some of these are really cute. It also comes with some cloth bracelets and plastic pieces. For the price and how much you get you can’t beat it. I would definitely repurchase,1
"Was concerned at first because the price is so low, but I'll order every week now. Buy this salmon, it's good.",1
Just the right ripeness to last me a few days.,0
"For some reason, fresh deliveries the sweetest strawberry ... I literally spend $35 on here to get strawberry",0
Large fresh berries.,0
The watermelon was hard and lacked flavor although it was a deep red color. The red was such a deep color it made we google whether or not food producers add red dye to watermelon. Would not buy again.,2
"I don't get why they sell unripe avocados, the knife couldn't even cut through it, it was so hard. I had to wait an additional 2 1/2 days in order for it to soften up just for me to eat it. Even then it had a weird bitter taste. I wouldn't be buying avocados online again.",2
"Awesome product and great tasting. However, this order i purchased arrived a bit wilted. Contacted Amazon customer service and they issued a refund within 24-48 hours. Amazon customer service is amazing. Because of their loyalty to customers, I will probably buy again.",1
Very good fresh berrues,0
These are so good and I'll buy them every time I make an Amazon fresh order.,1
"These are by far the worst bananas ever. I have bought it many times from amazon, mostly because these are the only ones available recently. Every time about 90% of the bananas are mushy. No we are not waiting a week to eat them. This often happens within the same day we get it delivered. The bunches come wrapped in huge sticky tape and most of the mushiness is within those taped areas. We have wasted a lot of money buying and throwing these. Not buying anymore. I wish amazon would remove them and stock up on other brands.",2
"Taste good, but I ordered it just once. Not sure if the taste will be consistent. Some people say it might change.",0
Blown away at the freshness and quality.  I figured this would be a test to see if fruit can be delivered without destruction.. Amazon passed with flying colors,0
I’ve on a huge organic kick over the last few months and to have the kind of price point and quality I’m all for buying again  and again,1
I wear these probably everyday fo work and they have yet to tarnish! I would buy these ten times over!,1
Shopping online is convinient but not everything can be bought like this. Every time I have ordered any fresh fruit such as the watermelon or pineapple it wasn't very fresh that day or would go bad literally within a day or 2. Not buying again.,2
"i didn’t expect to receive so much watermelon! it was such a great value for the price. the fruit was sweet, juicy and exactly what i needed after a long day. will be ordering more.",1
"I received my 2nd order, which I wanted to love… but I couldn’t get past one ring being damaged. I decided to return and try another order. I’m excited to see which ring I will order next. The ones that weren’t damaged were very unique and pretty yet still.",1
"Not very happy with this purchase... I was expecting a balanced variety of ring sizes. However, most of the rings will NOT fit on any of your fingers except your pinky and I have small hands! Some did not even fit on my pinky. Out of ALL the rings, I was able to use maybe 8 on a different finger other than my pinky. Would not recommend. Would not buy again. The description should say ""FOR KIDS"".",2
I like it it's ok good prize an everything. I'll buy it again for it's fresheneds,1
"All were rotten, disgusting. Will not order again.",2
Thea best thickness the strawberries I had. Good flavor and was fresh which I love .,0
"I haven't had a decent berry not to mention the strawberry that i ate in Europe and there i really tasted real strawberries juicy and sweet unlike the ones in those markets calling them organic, like eating a piece of cucumber...no taste",0
Love this product,0
"I received the mangoes green.  When the fruit turned yellow, their flesh was extremely SOUR!  I did not likethe sourness so I discarded them.  I won't buy these again!",2
I will always buy it when I order fresh.,1
Ruby red grapefruit is pretty good here on Amazon fresh. I would definitely buy it again.,1
The products arrived fresh and well packaged by the driver.,0
Most were in fresh condition...only a few were inedible.,0
"I just received my package today, but so far I am very impressed! Each of the earrings that have backs on them came with 3 pairs of backings, PLUS there was an additional bag of rubber backings with a ton in there. The packaging also came with some free hair ties. Some of the earrings are a bit heavier, and while I haven't worn them for an extended period of time yet so I do not know how they will last, I am very impressed with everything that was included for the price. I would purchase again.",1
Fresh and good,0
Sadly I decided on organic pineapple and on 2nd day trying to trim discovered it was rotted on inside. I tossed it in the garbage. Will not order these again. I do shopping all online and unfortunately don’t get to see the produce myself.,2
Again I didn’t relish the idea of buying produce for delivery but I will definitely buy it again,1
Fresh and yummy,0
"I thought plums would be a relatively safe product to buy online from a service called *FRESH*.I was wrong.Half the plums are a yellow-green. The rest look like red plums. With any luck, storing them in a paper bag will ripen them into something edible.I was a sucker for Amazon's marketing once again. I think this will have finally ensured I learned my lesson and I won't buy actual fresh food from Amazon Fresh again.",2
"Great quality product, I would purchase again.",1
"I was skeptical at first after reading some other reviews, and seeing other pictures. But all 4 of my peppers were great In size, color, freshness and taste!!! Can’t wait to order more!",1
"Rather sad - this is a good deal, price wise, but quality is not there.  They were old looking, quite small compared to their usual product.  And covered with eyes and rotted spots.  Not much to salvage.  Three pounds and many meals out in the trash.  Second time this purchase has failed. Not going to buy these again.",2
Just under-ripe when delivered which is what is what we want.  Good size and held up well.,0
Will definitely order again. They were perfect to eat that day and not bruised. It will be interesting to see how consistently they come through that way.,1
We loved these,0
These strawberries were fresh and had a great taste.  Impressed with the bight quality of these berries.,0
Will never buy again!  Was looking forward to fresh mushrooms.  One's I recived were turning brown & black! Was able to eat very few. Not worth the price.,2
"I love this cedar-planked salmon.  It is so moist and tasty.  Definitely worth the purchase.  I will purchase this again.  If you love salmon, try this.  You won't regret it.",1
Very delicious large fresh strawberries.  I will buy again.,1
I just recieved my order and a third of the strawberries are moldy,0
Arcola,0
"The ones I received are a lot better than the one in stock at my grocery store and they where way bigger too, would be ordering more to see if they are consistent in size and flavor.  Will update review if anything changes",1
"These strawberries were just OK, especially compared to the Bartlett pears and navel oranges I got in the same order. The individual berries were large, but they were not close to ripeness, though they tasted better than one would expect. Probably would not order again. Bought in Los Angeles.",2
This came rotten. Was brown and even brown juice was leaking from it. Won’t order lettuce again from here.,2
"Good product, Fresh , Will recommend friends. Will buy again.",1
The bananas were already goin bad by the time I received them .. never will order fruit from here again,2
"Give me a break! The only ripe berry was a large one on top! The others were ALL half green and tasteless, every one of them! And it was obviously intentional. A total ripoff. (And strawberries don't ripen once picked.) Hopefully they'll at least make good compost.",0
It will forever be My favorite jewelry purchase. I will buy again for sure,1
Oranges could not be eaten. Sof. One orange had mold. Will not purchase again. Waste of money.,2
Good,0
Ordered this not sure how fresh they would be. I am happy to report they were indeed fresh and delicious!! Ordered again and was equally satisfied! Will still order again,1
Produce was fresh and juicy,0
Fresh and succulent.,0
Half the oranges in this bag are visibly crushed &/or rotten. I will not order from Amazon Fresh again.,2
"I’ll have to admit, the person who picked the produce and the person who delivered it did a great job. No moldy or overripe strawberries. They were sour, but worked well frozen for smoothies the next day.",0
These were beautiful and delicious!,0
The fish was fresh but the portion size was tiny and not as reflected in the picture. I will be purchasing again for the freshness and convenience but will know to buy a few pieces to feed 2 or more individuals.,1
Your produce is now some of the best where I shop,0
Perfect Strawberries! I though they would be bad since it’s November but they look like summer strawberries!,0
very fresh taste very good,0
Wow! First time ordering amazon fresh and they did not disappoint the strawberries are perfect not one mushy one!!! Unbelievable! Compared to all the bad reviews Thanks amazon! My breakfast was super yummy and fresh!,0
Nope. Gross. I won't buy again. Thanks.,2
"Strawberrys are my favorite and I'm very picky when it comes to them. Everytime so far that I ordered them on here, they come so fresh and pretty! No bruising and great flavor!",0
"Mushy, brown. Will never buy again",2
"Love these little easy to peel, super flavorful, juicy bites of Heaven! Will keep ordering these and getting in my extra Vitamin C☺️",1
Always deliver greenish/brownish bananas. Never again.,2
"A bit brown on the inside, I'm  hesitant to buy again from Amazon fresh.",2
"These came to me in bad quality. Peel separated from clementines, most of them dried out with no juice. Wouldn't buy this specific fruit again.",2
Oranges were old. They didn't even last a week before I they withered away to nothing. And a couple were molding. I won't be buying any produce through here again.,2
Very ripe they don't last for more than 24 hrs. Never buying grocery again from Amazon fresh worst decision ever,2
Wouldn’t recommend getting any cantaloups my last 2 orders have come rotten! Not buying them again! Lesson learned,2
"I bought 3 of these. One package wasn’t so fresh. They had brown pieces in it. The other 2 was ok. The taste wasn’t sweet. But it doesn’t matter to me much about the taste cos I use it in my smoothies and I make it sweet. The thing I wanted was just fresh fruit that I didn’t have to stand there and cut up myself. Lazy.Anyway, I’ll probably buy it again. Recommend!",1
"Didn't bother taking a photo this time, but second time ordering and had the exact same issue as the last one I bought. As other reviewers noted, there was mold forming on the bottom after one day, it didn't arrive ripe and by the time you think it's ripe enough to eat the inside looks questionable, some parts darker than others, it doesn't smell good and you are scared to eat it. I had to toss my last one and I will probably toss this one too. I will not buy again from now on. Such a waste of money!",2
Ohhhhh Yeeeeeeeah  - so sweet and crisp and delicious- even after being in the fridge 24hrs before opening. Sweetest watermelon I’ve had all season from anywhere.I am in AZ so remember that quality probably depends on where you live - but for the Valley of The Sun this is a must!!! Definitely buying more,1
"When I first saw and felt them, I thought that these were a bit soft to be fresh and tasty.  When I ate one, it was very juicy and good.  So much better than regular cucumbers or English cucumbers -  I will buy them again.",1
"This was my first time cooking salmon so admittedly I don’t have a ton of experience, but this salmon was some of the best I’ve ever had! It came out moist and flavorful, and only one or two small fish bones left in that were easy to pick out.I do wish they split this into 3 fillets instead of 2 larger ones, but that’s okay. I’m definitely buying this again!",1
Got strawberries that were going bad and squishy,0
"These are often moldy and therefore not worth the price sometimes. The flavor is okay, even when it's not in season.",0
Don’t know,0
This is like the third time ordering fruits and they did not come fresh at all. When they arrived they came with mold at the bottom which contaminated the rest of the fruits. Would not recommend getting fruit. Every fruit I have ordered came with mold and hand to throw away them all away.,0
Whole Foods always has the freshest produce. Limes are great quality and are juicy. Would repurchase again,1
"This review is only for my last purchase of this product. It was my 3rd or 4th time ordering, usually it's fresh and tasty. This last time however the packaging was damaged and open. It had gotten everything in the bag slimy and I wasn't comfortable eating it as I didn't know how long it had been open. I went through the return process that day but the system would not let me submit my claim, instead it went me in a loop taking back to the start of the process. No salmon, no refund. Won't buy again.",2
"Fresh-n-tasty, will order again.",1
"I was thrilled that the strawberries that I received were Driscoll's strawberries as I think they are always sweeter than any other strawberries that I try.  They were fresh and unbruised, and very sweet.",0
"I LOVE this salmon! It has always been fresh!  I have ordered three times, and I will continue to buy weekly.  Try it!!! You will not be disappointed.",1
Almost the same price as the grocery store. Flavor seems the same. Will buy again.,1
Great flavor and texture. Would buy again,1
Mold and sour.,0
I’m pregnant and currently munching on these NOW. So juicy and delish! Great buy will definitely purchase again.,1
"Always come fresh, my kids always tear these up, I usually get 2 at a time",0
"Fresh taste and I have purchased several times with the same result. I get the same quality and cost per pound through my local shop so if the price increases here, I'll continue buying them.",1
"It’s lettuce. It was large and good quality. I will buy more when I require more lettuce.Also, wrap your lettuce in aluminum foil to make it last longer",1
These bananas we're very strange they looked right when they arrived but when I opened them they were completely spoiled and by the next day they had turned completely Brown very strange I would never buy these again.,2
"My favorite fish is salmon, so had to order when this was offered on Amazon, tho’ I had never before bought fish I didn’t personally choose.  I was not disappointed.  These are 6 oz. each, a “correct” portion size, but I would have preferred a more generous 8oz. size.  The salmon was very fresh with good medium coral color and broiled up well with my usual Firecracker Sauce glaze - a recipe saved from our local paper over 20 years ago.  Would order this salmon again.",1
"Most of the pieces were not close to ripe. A few were so bad I just threw them in the compost bin. The remaining ""ripe"" pieces were not very flavorful. Would not purchase again!!!",2
"sour, dry, not good at all.  I was looking for Cuties but they were out.  Never again will I waste my money on buying these.",2
I like them all different sizes and some of them are adjustable so you can wear them on any finger I will order more beautifull stone colors.,1
"Always wash my fruits in vinegar. Ate a bowl of strawberries and raspberries before bed Sunday & I thought they tasted a little weird but didn’t give it much thought. The next day I started to feel ill, then a fever, horrible body aches, headaches, chills & more. Thought it was covid, but haven’t really been anywhere in 2 wks (also tested negative). Now that most of my symptoms are cleared, I still have no appetite, no energy and a weak stomach. I have all of the symptoms of food poisoning.",0
I've bought this several times and each time there was scales still on the fish and I've gotten stomach aches each time! I'm not going to order and torture myself with this ever again,2
Good,0
"Sometimes they are ok and sometimes they are mushy, on the verge of going bad or with “fuzzy” patches already. The taste is fantastic though.",0
The limes this time around had very little juice and made it difficult to complete the cocktails. Hopefully it will be better when I buy next time.,1
"I like these  strawberries.  They are plump, sweet and delicious.",0
"Not as fresh as I would like it to be, will not buy again. Used tons of garlic and lemon and it was just meh...",2
"I didn't have high expectations, especially from shopping online for fresh produce. It suprised me, fresh and ready to eat!",0
Almost perfect. Just a bit too tangy still for my tastes. But good.,0
love them. got a great price and would buy them again.,1
"This was the most perfect container of strawberries I have ever purchased! They were sweet, ripe, and yummy!",0
"Love these rings, higher quality stones than I expected. I will definitely order again. Would be nice to be able to select rings individually or by package. But can’t complain because they were all beautiful.",1
Disgusting. I cooked this up and started eating it and noticed something wasnt right the bottom part near the skin was a mess of worms. It was like a horror movie. Sure they gave me a refund but I dont know when I will be able to eat salmon again. It was one of my favorites but NOT ANYMORE...  really really really gross... Never buying again,2
"Okay!  LOLI order these alot because there delicious but lately....The Size....come on.... I mean the first couple times I ordered they were huge and AMAZING. But now.... Lord have mercy. I've never seen cantaloupes So Small lol..I won't stop online shopping but, i won't buy cantaloupe here again!",2
I will order more IMMEDIATELY!,1
Delicious,0
"SWEET AND JUICY. WE ATE SOME AND THE REST WE USED IN OUR UCE CREAM SUNDAES. DELICIOUS, WILL BUY AGAIN!",1
I'd definitely not buy these again.,2
Fresh and delious,0
These were great tasting strawberries!,0
"Thought I'd get some healthy snack for the office. I opened one and it tasted a bit off. I opened a second and now my hand smells of this ""rotten"" orange smell that I can't get off. I've been scrubbing it and washing with alcohol and smell is still bad. I don't think I'll be ordering this again.Not sure what I'm gonna do with the rest.Edit: I ended up throwing it all away cause they were bad. Shame.",2
"It wasn’t fresh, they were mushy old and moldy. Not buying again",2
"I would never ever order bananas from Amazon again. I made a mistake and ordered 2x. First time I was surprised to see it turn from green to brown. I thought okay maybe I got a messed up bunch, didn't even bother to call and get a refund. The second time I figured it won't be the same and yet there it was. Upon receipt it was all green then a day or two later it turned brown. There was no transition from green to yellow to brown. It was the worst. I've never seen anything like this!",2
Recommend,0
I was very pleased with food order that I received from  Amazon Fresh.,0
excellent taste,0
The bananas arrived smooshed and mushy. They look like they we packed under something heavy. A few of them we leaking banana liquid from the skins. Requested a refund and was credited immediately. Will try and buy again on a future order.,1
Leaves were fresh and lasted a long time!  Will buy again.,1
Couldn't believe how fresh this tasted. Amazed by the flavors and it was shipped fast and still cold. Will definitely order again!,1
Skeptical at first for ordering these through Amazon but surprised how fresh these berries were. Will order them again in the near future.,1
Sometimes the strawberries are so good. Last 2 times they were hard and had a sour/poor taste. Love when the produce is good but...,0
"I had to throw all 6 of the containers away as the cantaloupe wasn’t ripe and very hard, could not even chew it.  I won’t be purchasing this again.  The first 2-3 times it was perfect but this time it went in the trash",2
Great,0
We have ordered Strawberries several times.  They are good almost every time.  We had one batch out of about six that had a couple of rotten strawberries.,0
Several berries grew white mold in one day—in the refrigerator.,0
These was made very nice! Will be buying again soon,1
Not so fresh.  Won't buy again.,2
"Fresh, large & sweet strawberries! Worth it while I wait for strawberries to come back from the garden.",0
"I ordered the first time and they were good, thick, juicy, not bright red but deep red. The second time I ordered it was okay, had a few soft mushy strawberries but it was overall okay. This last time was another miss, I had a few rotten strawberries and the rest were fresh bright red strawberries. Just like everyone else pretty much says its a hit or miss with the freshness of the fruit. So buyer beware!",0
It had mold on the bottom. The strawberries were also small.I woudn't buy again,2
"Great taste, no bad ones showed to the bottom as found in major stores. Not tart, not too sweet. Would recommend eating within 7-10 days.",0
Every fresh vegetable and fruit was fresh and tasty.,0
"I am a senior, a bachelor. I must admit that I never used strawberries all that much… My girlfriend likes fruit and yogurt and so I now purchase strawberries for when she stays over.I have learned that fruits, especially strawberries, are very fragile, delicate and perishable… In this case, practically, the whole carton was damaged, dark, mushy… Amazon gave me credit for my purchase, but in this case, the experience was somewhat disappointing…",0
Half of ALL the strawberries were under ripe & tasteless. Was going to make freezer Jam with them but have to throw them out. NOT HAPPY! I WON'T PURCHASE AGAIN!,2
These plums were very hard and sour -  placed them in a bag to ripen and they never did! Will not buy again.,2
Had to throw it out. Slimy! Got a refund and won’t order again.,2
Whomever is choosing them have picked the bad batch the last 2 or 3 times I purchased. Will go into the store these these myself,0
I freaking love these. I am so mad when I went do an order this morning they were unavailable. I’ll have to order more. They are literally the best,1
Cool 99cents per bundle but when arrived all of them were rotten. At the base of the bananas it was squishy oozing out something gross. Upset ) :  so yeah never ordering this again,2
OMG they are the most beautiful rings I ever had they fixed perfectly they run small but they are perfect for me I’m so much in love with them that I want to cry of happiness they beautiful thank you so much I will keep buying from them I mean I couldn’t expect anything better for this price amazing,1
Great flavor and fresh! Will purchase more,1
Love how all fruits and vegetables were bagged together,0
"I dunno, I guess I'm weird. When you offer strawberries in the dead of winter in the US, I expect that you are offering something of the same quality that was just grown inside or somewhere where it's nice out, but man, these were some SAD strawberries. They looked like they'd been sitting in a fridge for 3 months before I even got my hands on them. They were wilty and shrinking, with a dark maroon color fading into brown by the day, and I'm shocked they weren't moldy. I cut them up bc no one would eat them looking like they did.",0
"I got to say the amazon fresh employees do a phenomenal job at hand picking the best produce. I’ve used instacart and other delivery services and they don’t compare to amazon fresh. Other services just pick fresh produce as first on top. No regard for visible damage to fruit or vegetable. Amazon fresh gets this right. I’ve order bananas, grapes, strawberries and more and they are all top quality. This has not been the case with instacart and other food delivery services. Don’t really need to use other services moving forward. I’m thankful my area offers amazon fresh",0
I purchased the sliced mangoes and the cantaloupe and both were unripe.  I  don't think that I will be ordering them again.,2
"If you ever have a need for green bananas that never ripen, Amazon is the place.  I bought them a couple times with the same results. Never again.",2
Absolutely delicious! I will keep re-ordering it because I can't get enough. So fresh and yummy!,1
"I went to pour the rest of my spinach into a pan and I noticed a bug and had to throw it all away. I thought i had missed something until I came to the reviews and saw the same bugs on another woman’s review, won’t be getting these again",2
"Very happy with the strawberry this time. Big and fresh, and they are super juicy and tasty. I wish the quality of the their fresh produce could be consistently good.",0
"I love strawberries. Unfortunately, these were way too ripe. I'd rather have not all the way ripened than soft and bad tasting. Sorry",0
Almost completely rotten when it arrived. I would never order this again.,2
"Wow! So many different sizes and a great variety. I’ll absolutely purchase this bundle again to gift! They’re separated in groups of 5-10 in individual packages, so you can easily gift for party favors or gifts. The handwritten note was so sweet!",1
The strawberrys where fresh and juicy!,0
All the fruits were not fresh.I will not purchase fruits  again.,2
Rated 3 stars because it went bad within 3 days. But upon arrival it looked and taste great.,0
Delish,0
Very fresh. So good. I wish more chunks came in the container. Will definitely order more!,1
These last through the week wen I have a recipe rather than looking old or having mold in 1-2 days like most purchased in grocery stores.,0
"Good product, Fresh ,Will recommend friends. Will buy again.",1
"Maybe I just got unlucky, but this is my first time using Fresh and the strawberries were not that fresh. I received them yesterday and when I made breakfast with them today they were already bruised with soft spots as if I'd had them for a week. Hopefully when i order next time they'll at least last a few days before starting to turn.",1
"This product was fresh, juicy, sweet, and very tasty. I will order it again when it gets back in stock I do recommend this fresh water melon chunks.",1
I bought this and when I was going to cut it the next day it was rotten. I went to pick it up and my fingers went right through it.  Highly disappointed. Will not buy again.,2
"Came fresh, full flavor, juicy.",0
"Reading reviews I was hesitant to buy but I was having a craving for some watermelon. For some reason, the local stores watermelon were not that great. The first bite was yummy. I put it in the refrigerator for 2 hours and ate the whole tray. Yay Amazon Fresh. Would order more often",1
They were bruised really bad when deluvered....I had to throw them away..won't order them online again,2
"I was thrilled when I received my Amazon fresh delivery, my milk was icy cold, my turkey was in a freezer bag, and these strawberries were so firm and full of flavor. Honestly, these strawberries were awesome and that's the reason I continue to order from Amazon fresh. before that I was going to the supermarket all the time, I love the fact that I can order online and my groceries are delivered at the exact time I specify either later in the day or the next morning . Amazon thank you, you have a loyal customer. Definitely buying more ❣️",1
"I took this out of the fridge and opened it within two hours of delivery and the watermelon chunks were already bad.  Moldy seeds in the old chunks made it inedible.  Old melon gets a 'clear, soft' look about it after it sits a while and most of the chunks had turned in spite of the fact that I had just received it.  Looked like my watermelon has in the past when it's about 5 days since I cut it.  So I estimate that the freshly delivered watermelon was cut at least five days earlier plus it had Black mold in seed areas.  Threw it away.  Never again.",2
Surprisingly sweet,0
Since COVID-19 my family has tried different methods for grocery shoping. This is my first fresh grocery order with Amazon. I was testing to find out what quality the produce would be. I was not disappointed. I could not have picked better if I was there and did it personally. I will definitely buy again.,1
It was rotten inside never again,2
Good,0
They were moldy and rotten.,0
Four of the strawberries were moldy and a few others were really soft. Bought them to dip in chocolate but couldn’t use them.,0
"I won’t buy fruit from Amazon fresh ever again .  The fruit was not ripe, had no flavor and was a major disappointment.",2
"I have purchased this quite a few times from fresh.  Most of the time it is good.  However, a few times I thought they cut it too close to the rind, and it was not so good.  I will buy it again.",1
Almost all the strawberries in the batch were good. Tossed about 1-2 of them but I am picky.I likely would have picked up this batch if I was looking for strawberries in the store (it looked healthy).,0
"Dont waste a penny on this. I ordered 5 times, 4 times it was dark, mushy and tasteless. Yes, I learned, not to order it ever again.",2
These are the sweetest strawberries ever!,0
The rings are super cute but most of them are really small and the color fades off. I would reorder in bigger sizes,1
My batch was great! But definitely sounds like the employees picking the orders aren't paying enough attention to bad produce.,0
Perfect! good price and i would say small to med in size. Thanks! Will order again!,1
3 blueberries  were moldy on bottominstead of eating gave to squirrels never buy again,2
"Fresh: Absolutely. The smell of the strawberries was instant, strong and tasted sweet.Value: When I purchased it on Amazon Fresh it was $2.97, in my opinion that price and lower is a good deal for summer prices.Vendor: My strawberries came in the Driscoll container.Overall, the value was worth purchasing strawberries and I would totally recommend ordering via Amazon Fresh during the summer. So far I have purchased 7 or 8 packs this summer and have not had an issue. Wash thoroughly and enjoy. I hope the picture of the fruit helps in your decision.",0
Earlier this year the strawberries were a great value for the price point but now are cheaper than when they were in season. It's pretty obvious at this time why that is since the last 3 orders I have made for them over the past month and a half have had the strawberries coming covered in mold. Even after disposing of the obvious bad ones the entire batch goes bad within 2 to 3 days. Absolutely not worth anyone's time nor money. Terrible quality control.,0
"Each berry looked like it was created just for me. Great size, big but not too big. Succulent. All mine. Always surprised with the quality and freshness of produce Amazon provides.",0
"Obvious:  If u like iceberg lettuce, you'll like this product.  It arrived very fresh, which is great, and I'll probably buy again.  But I wd definitely pass up this small head in a supermarket.",1
I was very surprised how quickly this went bad. I'm not sure I'll be ordering things like this from Amazon again.,2
"I've bought these several times and overall I like them, but it's a total toss-up. They send whatever available brand they have from California, Georgia or Florida. Sometimes they've been delicious, sometimes they're green, within the same season.",0
WILL ORDER MORE!,1
Yum,0
"I grew up close to the Adriatic See and know something about fish. The salmon we had yesterday was not what I expected. The package was leaking which was not a good sign to start with. Fish smelled “fishy” (NOT a sign of any fresh fish), had unappealing dry texture. When cooked, even my cat didn’t want to sample it . Will not buy again",2
Eat Love strawberries,0
"I was absolutely upset when I received these strawberries. Not one was salvageable, they were all soft and had begun to grow mold in the middle. Very disappointed with the person that actually picked out this container of strawberries.",0
I will keep on buying this salmon on my amazon fresh!They come super fresh and nicely packed.The don’t have any strong smells and they taste great,1
Washed them and ate them as soon as I got them. They were perfect!,0
"There were a couple of molded berries in the bunch. Not an enormous problem, but would not have bought that container from a store.",0
"Out of the 11 limes I had bought and squeezed with a lime squeeze, I got 1/2 cup. They were so bad. No juice. Some had brown spots inside. Never again will I buy produce for Amazon Fresh",2
Not as sweet as last batch! But very good. It’s early in the season - probably.,0
I wouldn’t buy again. They were rotten,2
These strawberries were perfect!  I was so skeptical to order fresh produce online but whoever the picker was I couldn't have done a better job myself. There was literally one strawberry that was slightly bruised. Impressive! I will order more,1
"Love m! Great taste, they go in my yoghurt and boom nice flavor…",0
"The berries were fresh but hardly ripe at all, at least half of each one is light yellow green. You would think whoever picks orders would choose good produce and send ripe berries, but no. So value for money is really bad since half can’t be eaten or used.",0
"It arrived fresh, sweet, juicy & crunchy! Will buy again",1
Bananas were a full green (no yellow peaking out) when we got them and when they finally ripened it was bad. Black almost instantly. We were lucky to get 2 out of them. Wasted purchase. Never again!,2
Not in season . nkg dnohgh over all ok,0
Already moldy,0
My sons loved this product and will definitely be purchasing more indeed,1
The strawberries were beautiful and really fresh. They tasted great too!,0
Avocados super hard will not buy again,2
These are always moldy. Every single time. I stopped ordering them a while ago. Recently ordered again and they again arrived moldy. I won't order again,2
Was so good,0
These are the best grapes I’ve purchased ever. They are crunchy and sweet. I will buy more! I definitely recommend!,1
"The first time I received these, they were already molding. Anticipating that it was a one-time fluke, I got more. They arrived looking a little sad and then molded shortly after. Won't order again.",2
"was pleasantly surprised by the strawberries that showed up with my delivery order. even in california at this time of year, strawberries in grocery stores can be less than ideal. these exceeded my expectations by a mile. very good firmness, condition and flavor. i would order again at the right price. they were an excellent value at the price i ordered them at.",1
This is like the 3rd time in a row where I have ordered a bell pepper and it was rotten. I used to get them fresh and I don’t know what changed or who they got picking these damn veggies but it’s frustrating. This was my last time ordering this veggie.,2
"These are very cute mini cucumbers, but they went bad almost immediately and were extremely bitter no matter how much I washed them. I will not be buying them again.",2
"The lettuce from Amazon has always been a bit pricier than the same size head in the brick and mortar store. This is not organic lettuce. It's just priced so.The heads used to be decently sized. But the last few have been pitiful. And the price keeps going up. Not only are they very small, they are not as fresh. Unlike other forms of veggies and fruits which are priced by weight, the lettuces are priced by the head. So you are going to pay the same price no matter what condition the lettuce is in.I would give this item two stars, but I give credit for the decent ones I've gotten in the past.  I will not order lettuce from Amazon any time soon.",2
Organic and fresh-I hope. It was good! I would rebuy. I think the pkging can cause sum browning. Not alot. I would buy again..,1
The strawberries are not fresh at all. A few of them were infected with fungus on it.,0
"won't buy again, there must have been a shortage",2
Fresh and tasty strawberries. Packaged well and arrived  in good shape. Would buy again.,1
Great value....,0
"Absolutely gorgeous! He/She left a very sweet thank you card! So many rings to choose from and different sizes it’s gorgeous and I will definitely repurchase soon! Worth the money! So many to choose from, variety of rings! BUY THEM NOWWW!!",1
Sweet and tasty berries,0
I was wondering if the strawberries will be like the ones from the market where some are good and some are rotten lol but all my strawberries were big and red :),0
very tasty. I would order again.  FRESH,1
"I like a fresh spinach salad.  I have bought this 365 brand spinach several times, both from Fresh and Whole Foods.  For some reason it is tougher than other brands and the stems are even worse.  Lately (during pandemic), it seems even tougher.  Not sure why.  I do not feel I should have to be trimming stems off each leaf on salad mixes, nor do I have the time.  I have seriously choked on it three times to where I got splinters running through my body and worse.  That is not the way I plan to go out!  Will not buy this brand again!  There are two other brands that are just fine and tender, and I have never had problems.  I will stick with them.",2
"With my latest purchase, the whole outer flesh of the pineapple was rotten and soft. Had to throw it out. The organic pineapple I bought a month earlier was sweet and very good. The quality is not consistent. Since I shop online, I am hesitant to order another one. Maybe the distribution center or store should cut a few of the pineapples open to verify the quality before accepting the shipment.",2
The strawberries were not sweet.,0
"Hit or miss.  It’s nothing like shopping in a store for your own produce.  Most of these weren’t ripe and and had bad spots.  After two days, the remainder had molded.  Some people just don’t know how to shop for produce.  Others don’t care.  I’m always praying for my fruit when I order via Amazon.  It’s 50/50 with them.",0
The strawberries were fresh and delicious. Buying it again.,1
Definitely good and fresh! Will buy again!,1
The salmon was fresh it was tasty. I would buy it again.,1
most of the oranges were stained black which made me feel uncomfortable to eat them; there was one that was completely rotten. won’t order this ever again.,2
"My cantaloupe was rotten to the core, I didn't get a chance to eat it, had to throw it in the garbage, I'm going to try Whole Foods fruits and vegetables, I'm noticing Amazon fruits and vegetables are not up to par.  If I have to keep calling Amazon for a credit every time I get a disgusting fruit/vegetables whats the point, I wont be buying from them anymore, I've had it!",2
"Taste like chemicals, texture is like styrofoam.Never buying these again.",2
Can't go wrong with halos love them I'll buy agsin,1
"So what arrived wasn't the freshest sadly, however they worked well in a smoothie later that day.",0
"The only thing good about the this watermelon was the color, it had no flavor and the texture was off. Seemed like it had gone bad or something, never buying it again",2
"These earrings are super cute in theory but when I received them all of the styles that have a clasp we’re broken. None of them will clasp, due to the  fact that all the clasps are metal i am unable to fix the issue. without being able to clasp them they just fall out as i move around. the ones with regular backs however, are super cute and stylish, overall i would not purchase again due to the fact that half of them are defaulty Most of the styles are light weight a few are a little too heavy.",2
Fresh and delicious,0
moldy strawberries,0
"My car is not working right now so I’m having to order groceries on Amazon. And I have to say every time I’ve ordered these they go bad in a day, and get very soft. When I get them they are already dark red and mushy. I have to say I no longer order bread, milk, or fruit from Amazon because it all spoils fast and expires the day I get it or 2 days past the date I get it. Get it together stop sending out old almost expired food. It’s disgusting.Update: just wanted to update my review. I ordered another batch and they were perfect, ordered another and they were perfect as well. It’s hit or miss with these.. but when they don’t arrive moldy, they taste great! Hopefully they keep coming fresh like they have been.",0
The limes I received were the same quality I would have selected for myself. I will order again.,1
I won't buy this again,2
The freshness was not there.,0
The avocados I received were soft on the outside and rock hard on the inside.  This is even after letting 2 of them sit for almost a week.  Complete waste of money as they were inedible.  I will never purchase again.,2
"HORRIBLE!! Even after you cook them for the required amount of time, the outside will be soft but the inside is still super hard. And it has a gross taste. Does not taste like sweet . Every one of them tastes off. Almost like there rotten even though they look fine from the outside. There is something wrong with these things. can't figure these things out. They are very strange and they have a terrible taste. They are not normal. They do not taste like sweet potatoes. They are very off tasting. Very very disappointed. Never buying these again!",2
"Fresh, tasty and wonderful in salad.  Stood up to balsamic vinegar without surrender.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  Firm yet tender texture.  Sliced nicely.",0
Could be better but fresh,0
"These were over-ripe on arrival, and were obviously mushy and bruised.",0
Fresh & flavorful,0
"I started buying these because of excellent, consistent, flavor.  Over the past months, more and more of the mandarins were tasteless duds.  The last two bags are all tasteless duds.  I will no longer buy these. Sadly, I will not know it the quality returns.  I have already continued to buy these hoping for change, but now must stop throwing money away.",2
Most of the mango was I ripe and tasteless.  I will wait until spring to order again.,1
Thank you,0
"The strawberries looked fresh when they arrived, but they did not taste ripe. They were bitter, and dry. They look nice, but  its been over a week and they still look fresh. I'll end up using these to sweeten water with it, but I did not like eating them plain.",0
"Really enjoyed this product, cute designs and durable. Also really liked the handwritten thank you note. Would definitely recommend and will be making future purchases from this carrier.",1
"Delicious fresh fruit. All of the strawberries were ripe and in excellent condition. This was part of my 1st Amazon Fresh order, and I was very impressed.  The pricing and quality was better than the same brand of strawberries from my local market.",0
"Unfortunately, the third purchase of these potatoes showed war wounds, scarred and mostly small ones which began to rot after a week.  One was white flesh inside, but the flavor is better than most of this type. Will continue to buy, in spite of complaint.",1
Great strawberries!,0
I have always ordered online and the shopper that picks my strawberries EVERY TIME picks a container that has AT LEAST 3 rotten strawberries in their.  It's disappointing because i end up losing half the container before it get put in the refrigerator.,0
"I love canteloupe but the few times that I have ordered this from Fresh, the pieces have been hard as rocks with zero flavor. Same for the combo honeydew/canteloupe container. Won't buy again.",2
"The bananas arrive unripe, took a while to get ripe. By the time I was ready to eat they were mushy and ended up throwing 3 of them in the garbage. I don't think I will buy bananas this way again.",2
The strawberries are sour,0
"Appearance was nice & good flavor.  But every time I ate one or two I felt sick (near vomiting), even after rinsing throughly. They molded quickly, so had to discard the majority of them.  I won’t be ordering them again.",2
"Whole Foods vegetables, for me, are always fresh. I will always purchase them here.",1
Your yourself the money and buy a whole melon and cut it yourself. The melon was overripe. Some parts slightly mushy. Never again. I should’ve read the reviews first.,2
So fresh!!! Great! Buy every week,1
won't order again,2
"This product is for my 6 nieces. They were received in 8 zip locked packs, suitable for stocking stuffers.  Care was taken in packaging. I even received the sweetest thank you note from this company! I would order again.",1
They went bad in my fridge. Not good.,0
"Most of the are knuckle rings, and those are fun, some is them are adjustable. There are a couple bigger sizes. The smaller ones though my nieces absolutely loved because three knuckle rings fit them all the way!!I would definitely buy again.(Tip so fingers don’t turn green, paint the inside with clear finger nail Polish)",1
Very enjoyable. Great price. Will buy more,1
"Good price, decent flavor. Better then the one i had bought at the grocery store. Would buy again.",1
"These rings are very cheap .. They turn my fingers green and didn't come with the sizes it said came with them .. Some rings were very sharp and some were bent .. I do not recommend these rings to anyone .. I love jewelry but I do not love these at all .. I wished I'd never bought them .. Not gifable, not valuable and the comfort is just unbearable .. I would like to have my money back!!! I threw every one of those rings away because in the trash is where they belong!!!!! I will never buy again",2
The strawberries I received were not sweet and were “wet” on the bottom.  The middle ones had some mold.  I picked out what I could and threw the rest away.,0
"They were ripe, not soggy or overly hard. They were nice and sweet as well so I’ll definitely purchase again.",1
"It seems that other reviewers are expecting a large Mexican or Guatemalan papaya, but these papayas are Goldens from Brazil and they will always be small, that's the variety. If you are looking for the big papayas, look for ""Tainung"", ""Formosa"", or ""Maradol"".This one was nice and sweet, will buy again!PS: Love that they are non-GMO!",1
I had to right a review after the huge price increase... Although I don't think this is worth almost 13 dollars now.. Great Quality the portion sizes vary Inwish that was consistent but I'll still continue to buy,1
"I purchased this from Whole Foods Irvine, CA location (Amazon pickup). Strawberries were SPOILED/OLD/MOLDY! This has happened multiple times at this Whole Foods location. I will no longer be buying from here. With inflation skyrocketing, it doesn't make sense anymore to pay premium price for spoiled products. Shame on Whole Foods for not fulfilling your ""freshness guaranteed"" promise SHM!!!! Quality has been going downhill for a while and it's a million times worse now! :(",2
"The strawberries arrived and looked so fresh but when I tasted them they tasted like chemicals. I had to throw all of them out, would never buy again.",2
All the berries are terrible looking and all different sizes small and medium. One even had holes in it like a bug ate part of it. Won't take a chance next time ordering fresh fruits online instead of in person. Quality sucks if you're not able to look and get then yourself.,0
I was skeptical ordering Amazon fresh fish especially but so very good!  It was like butter and so flavorful!  Definitely will buy again.,1
Strawberries arrived fresh and clean. Tasted great too.,0
"Strawberries are on the smaller side and are very tart. However, the fresheners was great. The product seemed “new” and was not damaged during the shipping process.",0
These were the best strawberries!,0
We have learned the hard way not to purchase fruit on Amazon Fresh. They are always delivered going bad. We have cut open the cantaloupe the next day and it has been REALLY BAD already. Once we could tell when receiving it that is was already bad. I WILL NOT BUY FROM AMAZON FRESH AGAIN!,2
"Bag arrived early this morning and the ""Guaranteed Freshness"" was nowhere to be seen. Instead, I found what appeared to be green mold on at least 3 of the oranges (see photo). And the bag smells like moldy oranges. Not a great way to start the day. Vitamin C is so important to me as a senior living in a metropolitan city during a Pandemic. Would not order again!",2
THE ONES I GOT THIS TIME WERE SLIMY AND SMELLY! I WON'T BUY AGAIN!,2
"I went to cook it a few hours after delivery and it had a chemical smell, I rinsed and cooked it and after one bite it was terrible, I suspect it was going bad and they put chemicals on it to hide that and it tasted like a weird chemical. I found strawberries from prior Fresh order that had a similar chemical taste and went mushy the first day. I’m not ordering from Fresh anymore because of this.",2
This was a great gift for my 12 yr old daughter. She was so happy to receive this gift for her birthday. And it was a great price too. The smile on her face was priceless. I would definitely buy again.,1
I won't buy these again.,2
"When I first started ordering from Fresh, the packers seemed to be much more observant or maybe the strawberries are just bad quality now. You may happen to get a good carton but it is hit or miss. These are old - overripe to start and moldy within a day. When I tried to get refunded, it said I needed to contact customer service rather than go through the typical automated system. Give me a break.",0
"I took a chance on the strawberries, and I definitely regret it. The strawberry on top, which would be very visible to whoever picked it as it was not obscured by the label, was moldy. A lot of the other strawberries were bruised and/or on the verge of being moldy and had to be thrown out. Not pictured is a handful of other strawberries I had already thrown away. Of the ones deemed edible, most of them taste off, with only a handful tasting how strawberries should, including how they taste firm and less firm. I did wash them, so I don't know why they taste so strange, so I will not buy strawberries from Amazon ""Fresh"" again",2
"I can get strawberries from my local grocery, but these are like a photo model for strawberries.Tender, ripe, sweet and with a rich, full strawberry flavor.I'm seriously impressed.",0
Disgusting. This is how it was delivered.  The others were soft.I will not order these agAin,2
"Two things I did not like:  the fact the cantaloupe was not ripe, and the taste of salt added to the cut up pieces.  I have neve before tasted salty cantaloupe!  Maybe it is too late in the season? (October?) but I won’t order this again.",2
It doesn’t ripe well.Tasteless.I’m not buying it again.,2
"I ordered this via Amazon/WholeFoods delivery because my schedule wouldn't allow me to get to the store in time. Everything else in my order was fine except for this melon. Initially, I thought it might have just been a bit roughed up in transit, but when I cut into it, it was disgusting. Tasted of mold. Will not purchase again. Online buyer beware!",2
"First time i ordered no issues, lasted a decent amount of time, good flavour and size. Second time i ordered they were on their last legs and got mouldy after a day, disappointing. Won't buy again, too risky.",2
They don't look quite like the picture!  The strawberries weren't in very good shape.  I will not order again.,2
Really it’s good,0
"Not sure who bags the produce, but it's never a good experience for me. The top layer always covers the bad batch under it. I can honestly say that I'm not purchasing produce here again.",2
Great Job,0
Very good. Will reorder,1
We purchase some of the 365 everyday branded products and find them acceptable. We'll continue buying the brand along with others available.,1
"I don't understand,  purchased 9/5, package expiration says 9/20 but I opened it on 9/9. It stunk with a horrible odor of rotten flesh. There was a film of white mucus covering the fish. Dangerous and inedible on my first time ordering this. Portion size was small but I new it was only 12ounces when I purchased. I just wish they would be more careful about expiration dates don't think I'm purchasing fish here again.",2
Half of the pack was already in super bad shape,0
Nice,0
Not too bad but definitely not the best strawberry I know this store has.,0
I love strawberries and purchase them quite often. I ordered these through Amazon fresh to be delivered with other groceries and they had absolutely no flavor.,0
They were sweet and perfect for price,0
I love the little yellow mangoes and await the season every year.This one was wrinkled and old on the outside and unripe on the inside.  Not buying again.,2
totally worth the money! I ordered one of these and my kids nearly destroyed the entire bag in one day!!!•Super juicy•none of them where rotting•package was completely sealed! Definitely will be buying again!!!,1
As described. Strawberries were sub-par but I expected this from Amazon. No harm from trying but I would not order them again.,2
I like everything about the products I selected love my Amazon,0
"My 2nd order in a row with large, utterly beautiful & ripe strawberries. Yum!",0
"Arrived firm and green, which is what I was hoping for. No complaints! Will order again.",1
Bananas went from very green to brown and mushy. I will not buy them again.,2
"It's really really tough to screw up limes. I mean, they arrive mushy and gross and sunburnt, or they arrive damaged. These limes arrived in perfect condition!One thing I really liked about the limes we had ordered was that they have thin skins and each lime yields about 2-3oz of juice. The thinner skin is important, since it makes these limes easier to juice, and means that the vesicle to fruit ratio is leaning more towards the vesicles. More vesicles = more juice per fruit. I have included at least two limes in each of my AmazonFresh orders, just because they are great to have on hand, and you never really know when a meal will need a little kick of citric acidity. I recently learned that 1 lime's worth of juice adds a really nice freshness and perk to Green Chile Pork and Green Enchilada sauce. We use these for Pho, Pad Thai, Tacos... really anything. They're just great to have on hand, and perfect to juice when the skin starts to dry out.These limes are perfect. I will be buying them again... and again and again.",1
after one day although store in the refrigerator mold appeared on many of the strawberries,0
I had b4 ordered the small and was dissatisfaction too close to the rind not flavorful.Then I'm ordering again and all. Melons out of stock i waited a bit now only the 2lb was in stock so fine I need my fruits everyday I love melon. It came it seemed. HUGE. I imedietly opened itAnd it was sweet crisp fresh and tasted just like it should & very neatly cut in cubesI think it's a safer bet to get the large it seemed to me it's cut from the middle of the melon one large chunk and cubed then packed I couldn't stop eating it it was gone in 3 days didn't eat much anything else I was on a melon frenzied spree I d say go for the big size It will be a look and TASTE much better you'll be eating it non stopAnd watermelon is very good 4 u and not fattening I will order again for sureDeliciousWorth the price 4 cutting it up and neatly packing in a leak proof containerAnd easy cutting up one is a mess though 2 bad it's plasticSo yeah I urge you to get the 2lber cut up watermelon if u n family like melonYou'll be happy u didI wish I didn't eat it all so fastOh well I've other fruits till.the next time. Enjoy! And NAMASTE 2 you,1
"These little Sunkist ""Smilie"" clementines are ridiculously good. They are a little tart, very sweet, and packed with zesty orange flavor.They are easy to peel, I usually start them with a knife and the skin just pops right off.There is the occasional bland one in the bag that just doesn't taste very good, but in a big bag like this that's probably hard to avoid.I tried to find these at local stores but didn't have any luck. The local stores have a slightly larger version of these labeled as Sunkist ""Halo's"" that did not taste anywhere near as good as these, in fact they were completely bland.I don't know if these just happen to be in season right now or if they always taste this good, but I'm going to be ordering a lot of these while they last!",1
Very sweet strawberries. Very fresh.,0
"Spinach was fresh, not limp or slimy. I will buy it again.",1
"These were some really good Mandarins, too bad I forgot to do this review when I got them. These were full of flavor, really juicy as well. Only thing was that these I found to be a bit pricey and so I would buy them again but not too often.",1
"The strawberries were fine, all ripe or near to it. I think I only knock off a star as they are not competitively priced, so shopper be warned.",0
"I didn't know what to expect since this is the first time I've bought produce on-line.  I am delighted with the size, quality and freshness.  I will likely purchase more produce again in the future.",1
Ordered them before and they were great and fresh. Last order wasnt fresh and had mold on a few of them.,0
The grapes were very sour and and skin hard. won’t order from Amazon fresh again,2
"These are sweet, delicious, and super easy to peel - just as you would hope.  I would buy more often.",1
Came same day nice and fresh. I made smoothies.,0
They weren't sweet. I thought it would be fresher but they weren't  I was surprised but then you really can't tell how they will come out. I won't buy again,2
Done if the strawberries were molded.,0
"Delivery is nice. Freshness and flavor not so much. Do not think I’ll order fresh produce from Amazon anymore. The only good things I’ve gotten so far are cabbage, and a bag of mini carrots.",2
These were way too mini for my liking. Some of them were too hard to peel that I just threw them out. I'll probably never buy mandarins from Amazon ever again unless I know they'll be better next time,2
Limes had rotted spots and since they were not that costly I just threw them in the garbage disposal to clean it and have a lime smell in my kitchen.  I had to go buy some from the store.  I definitely won't buy limes on here again.,2
Grew fuzz in a day. Spoiled and had to throw out. Not happy! I won't buy my produce from Amazon again.,2
One tasted like gasoline.  I had through out the whole basket away.,0
"I bought watermelon, along with cut honeydew melon and cantaloupe. They made me so sick. I won't buy fresh cut fruits, again",2
The vegetables I've purchased thru Amazon Fresh have been some of the best I've seen in a long time!!  I would order again!,1
"My local supermarket has better strawberries. They are big , red and Lucious. WF Strawberries lacked color and taste.",0
"I don't know what has happened with Fresh, but it is super disappointing to see the produce quality go downhill.  After years of confidently ordering produce and receiving great quality, I have now had moldy strawberries for four weeks in a row, as well as bruised and rotten bananas so i won't buy again.",2
"Amazon fresh didn’t have my usual 4lb navel oranges, after still unavailable I ordered these. Not just sour, that’s fine. They are 3 lbs of garbage. Threw them away, costly mistake. NEVER AGAIN. I will buy single oranges if no more navel bags…or go elsewhere.",2
Perfect size was pleasantly surprise will buy again,1
Not only did it not have any flavor but they were mushy not edible and went straight to the trash,0
These strawberries are very sweet and delicious. Very fresh. Although I am buying this during the COVID-19 outbreak. So due to the speed at which the groceries are being sold that might be why it's fresh.,0
I absolutely love these and would definitely buy more styles in the future from them. I been wearing them almost everyday.,1
"The quart of strawberries I received were fresh, tasted good, and had a surprising amount of strawberries in it; I was worried they'd skimp out, but was pleasantly surprised by how many there were. Also, they lasted for several days, which means they must've been pretty fresh. Price was very good too, much better than the $7 they were at my local store at the time of purchase...",0
Product was good. Came fresh. Taste good. No complaints. Purchasing again.,1
Strawberries not as fresh as expected and not very sweet. Maybe it was late in season.,0
Cool and.refreshing snack,0
Will never buy these AGAIN. AVOID. They went bad VERY fast. there was mold after 2 days on these strawberries.,2
Both orders were nothing but water. Have you ever had water logged watermelon? I won't order anymore.,2
Now I don’t know when they are coming back but i assure you that i will be ready to buy a lot next time around,1
"These apples went bad within a week of purchasing. Normally, apples last forever. I’m hesitant to order these again. This was definitely abnormal.",2
"While the fish looked good and did not have an offensive odor, once I had prepared it and went to taste it, I about gaged. I will never buy it again and hopefully, at some point, I will be able to eat salmon again.",2
Fresh and tasty strawberries. Packaged well and arrived  in good shape. Would buy again.,1
"the bananas arrived green and black.  They were terribly bruised, I will never order produce from Amazon again.",2
This year alone the strawberries are candy my daughter has ordered these 3 different time and get it x2 and every time its dam near the same taste and no bitterness. Nothing but a sweet treat for the kids. Go ahead order them up about a month or so left before they are back to the basic again,0
Lots to toss - small container. Not very fresh. I likely won't order again.,2
Great price high quality.  I've ordered 3 times will still order again.,1
Love these!,0
"They look fresh when they arrived, but two of these had rotted badly within two or three days. I'm spoiled, I'm used to getting Granny Smith apples straight off the tree in Apple Hill California. Probably won't buy these ones again.",2
"Product was good. Came fresh. Taste good. Portion was two slices, good for one serving each. No complaints. Purchasing again.",1
"It's kind of hard to find sweet cantaloupe these days. This one was good could have been sweeter, but still not disappointed in price or buy. I recommend and will purchase again. Txs",1
"I received these on November 1st, it’s currently November 4th, and there are only 9 fresh strawberries. I've ordered them before and have an issue, but I thinks better to go to a local store and pick your own.",0
Ever so super quality. Superior delivery. Remarkably magnificent packaging. Would buy from here again,1
Sweet,0
"How can anyone pick something like this and get away with it? Seriously, I would never buy anything here again even if I was desperate.",2
GoodFreshReady to eatMmmmm good,0
I continue to buy these strawberries from Amazon fresh bc they are conveniently delivered to my front door. They are hit or miss. I think it mostly depends on the day and time I order from what I’ve noticed. If you order early early morning you get fresher items. I like the 5-8am delivery. I haven’t figured exactly which day is best but usually right before the weekend or right after as they have to restock new items during these times. I use this same theory with grocery shopping and it has worked for me. Try them. The flavor is good. The sizes vary. They are never uniform so I can’t ever make chocolate covered strawberries without having to order 2 boxes. They’re ripe upon delivery. Price is just ok for my area at 2.99/box considering there will be a couple duds. I will buy again for convenience!,1
nothing here,0
Amazon Fresh is the only place I will buy these grapes. They are good and fresh a Lil pricey but worth it. I would recommend it.,1
"The melon was super bland. When it arrived it was under ripe so I let it sit on the counter for a couple days to ripen. However, it never got ripe and instead began to rot. I will not be purchasing ever again.",2
They are truly hypoallergenic since I didn’t get a rash but a few of them are so difficult to get on and off. I like them overall but wouldn’t buy again.,2
The fish came rotten and I didn't notice until I cooked it and my house was filled with rotten fish smell for over two weeks I'm not buying again ,2
"Tasted dry and flavorless right from the get go, but were covered in green mold within 2 days of purchase.  My first time ordering from Amazon Fresh and this made sure I would not be ordering ever again.",2
Sent to out of town family. It was a perfect treat and arrived promptly,0
"Smallest head of lettuce I've ever seen, plus A litte brown in the middle too! Not worth the effort to eat.  I put some on 2 sandwiches and tossed the rest.  Never will buy it again from Amazon. Its too expensive to begin with!Amazon doesn't have the greatest produce. I usually get it elsewhere.  My bad for trying it again.",2
favourite fruit,0
"I received  spoiled, watery and with fungus.  What is this???  It is preferable not to send them like this. I will not buy them again.",2
"Ordered these several times. Sometimes we are sent mandarins, other times clementines, or simply a bag labeled ""citrus"". Most times they are rotten and inedible. I'm not odrering again.",2
These oranges were molded. Will not buy again.,2
"Would not buy again, not fresh, mole already growing on them, had to throw out.",2
I'm usually afraid for someone else to purchase my produce for me. I like to pick them out so I can pick the best ones! The grapefruit was so fresh and juicy and delicious! I will definitely order from them again!,1
Eat fast before they get soft,0
I ordered a cantaloupe and it was rotten.Then I ordered another one and it was rotten with mold on it. So I won't order fruit again.  The reason I order is because I'm disabled and really can't walk around a store. No I didn't request a refund.,2
"I was a little skeptical about buying produce online , but after reciving my order I will probably buy it again.  My strawberries were in good condition! Red and fresh I might have found one that was slightly soft but that's it! I was very pleased with my order ! I also bought blueberries,broccoli, salad, and apples they too were great!",1
"I bought these because recently they haven't been in my local supermarket. The first one I tried was a little dry; then when I started with the others .. same thing. They were all really dry, no juice. Felt like I was trying to chew on orange cardboard. Even the kids would not eat them. And I have goats for kids. They will basically eat anything .. except these. Will not be buying these again.",2
"Llegaron muy bien super recomendable, volvería a comprar",0
"The last few times that I've ordered strawberries, I had to throw most of them out because of dark spots and mold. I kept giving them another chance because they were good and fresh for a while on the beginning. I won't buy anymore.",2
"Really impressed with Amazon Fresh produce.  They deliver the 'prime' goods. Puns aside, I was worried about the inability to select my own fruits and vegetables but surprised that they either get much better quality than the grocery store or really good at choosing the best... Either way, I couldn't do it any better.",0
"I found this salmon to cook up very dry.  I'm accustomed to my fresh salmon being very tender and moist, but this fish doesn't have that when cooked the same way.  It also tasted a bit bland.  I don't think I will buy this again and instead make the trek to my local Whole Foods for the fish I prefer.",2
"The oranges arrived unripe (green spots), took a while to get ripe. Ate one early but it was bitter tasting when I was expecting sweet orange taste.  I don't think I will buy oranges this way again.",2
"Bought these twice from Amazon Fresh, both times arrived spoiled :( Kind of difficult to make dinner without one important ingredient. Won't buy from them anymore. Last order was specific - do not send me spoiled produce. Well, got spoiled produce :(",2
This is 10 times better than the kroger/walmart berry! I have to leave a comment for such amazing finding.,0
A few of the strawberries were bad and had to be thrown away,0
"As I feared it was under ripe, hard, and tasteless. I should have known better. But probably a hit/miss proposition. Worth a shot but won't buy again.",2
Finally I got a perfect lb of strawberries. I have been buying them from Albertsons for months and wasting money because they were not fresh. These were honestly the freshest strawberries I have had in a very very long time. Ordering again and I will hope for the same always.,1
Freshness..flavor awesome . I will buy two next time.Taste wow.,1
"Fresh, delicious, and great value. I will keep ordering.",1
"7/19/20 was the very first day/time that I ordered groceries from Amazon for delivery and while everything else that I ordered fresh was awesome, the berries started to get ""squishy"" feeling the next day and then today, 7/22 I went to make my smoothie and found that 2 berries were covered in white, fuzzy mold and another 2 had weird, rotten looking spots.The delivery was great, the ease of ordering was awesome and everything else is just fine, but for some reason, it seems the strawberries are ""hit or miss"". Overall tho, I'll continue using the service but i will likely not buy this product again",2
"hard, not fresh mangos.. won't be buying again",2
"also, those leaves that were in good shape, were a bit bland on flavor. i will not buy again, a local grocery has similar price (a tiny bit lower in fact) and much better quality and flavor. it is more convenient to get from amazon fresh, but not worth the drop in quality.",2
"Not as fresh as expected, wouldn’t purchase again",2
So fresh I will definitely buy again,1
These are extremely fresh,0
I was a little nervous purchasing strawberries through Fresh... but every single one of these strawberries was perfect. No bruises or mold - better than I've done for myself at local groceries. Perfectly ripe and ready to eat (and a great discounted price),0
Always comes rotting,0
"I’d hate to judge but these Strawberries looked good on the outside. True colors exposed that it’s personality was rotting on the inside  yikes, second changes are not bad to give but I’ll pass ‍♀️",0
Very disappointed ended up tossing it out in the garbage. Had a few pieces that were fine. The rest afraid of getting sick. Will not order again.,2
Moldy. So disappointed. My daughter ate several before seeing the mold. Won’t be buying produce from Amazon again.,2
Really good strawberries.  They were gone in minutes after the order arrived.,0
Use this for my kids fruit bowl the freshness was good will buy again,1
Same issue we had w mangoes and strawberries.  I’d rather go to supermarket with Covid or without it. I wonder why they put fruits that are not edible in my order.  Unless they were seated there for too long.  Don’t know. I will not buy it again. Sorry. Did get refund for bad fruits. Rather don’t go through aggravation again,2
These lasted longer than the spinach from Costco. It is the perfect size for 1 person. Will be ordering from Amazon Fresh again.,1
Started growing mold the 2nd day after I got it delivered.. had to throw it away.,0
Never again,2
My first time using Amazon Fresh. These strawberries were flavorful and crunchy. Love them as all the fruit that I ordered.,0
"good price, good quality, good date, tasted good. would buy again",1
Amazon Fresh Berries are consistently luscious.,0
"Was nasty not sweet hard n very soft in some places , never will I order fruit like that again from Amazon Fresh,  for those types of fruit u need in person up close an personal",2
The strawberries were not that sweet and half of them came moldy. I requested a refund.,0
"I just got these from Amazon fresh. Absolutely beautiful strawberries! Fantastic! Fresh and tasty! Not one strawberry was mushy, none were old, no dirt on the strawberries like you get at the grocery stores. Definitely Will buy again! Highly recommend! Happy customer!",1
"The strawberries were fresh, plentiful, and great tasting. I have to say that I started using A Fresh because of the virus but everything we have ordered, whether meat, fruit, or bread has tasted fresher & better than any of the grocery stores we always used before.  Makes us rethink our grocery shopping habits after the virus is over",0
These have been coming to me bruised so I won't be ordering them again.,2
I'll be also writing to the seller!! I was afraid to buy but I'll be buying them all!!,1
Very bad ...thrown away. Will never order fruits and vegetables online again,2
Convenient. Would buy again.,1
Delicious!!! My family loved it. It was my second time buying and will be buying again. Very good portion sizes.,1
"The pomegranates are huge and have a sweet delicious taste.They are expensive but they are big, will buy again",1
Great quality for the price. Would buy again!,1
Me quede verdaderamente sorprendida con la calidad de las fresas y el servicio de Amazon Fresh . En mi opinión personal para ser la primera vez que compro fruta por línea quedó totalmente  satisfecha con lo compra.,0
"the look and taste of the watermelon was delicious ate them right when the order got to me, sadly I was ill overnight very very ill i will not buy pre cut fruit ever again from anywhere i did receive a refund thanks amazon i still love u but not your pre cut fruit!!!!!",2
Good,0
Thank you,0
They tasted just like the real thing. The strawberry flavor was spot on.I am not sure why they are called strawberries. These berries do not taste like straw.,0
I love it so much,0
"Driscoll's Strawberries are among the best, freshest and most tasty in the world — but NOT when you buy them from Amazon Fresh.I've ordered strawberries from Amazon Fresh, twice now. And twice they've arrived bumped, bruised, squashed (due to poor packing) and bad or on the verge of going bad.WHO puts strawberries in a flimsy, crushable clamshell container at the BOTTOM of a brown paper grocery bag and then places heavy items on top of them? AMAZON *FRESH*, that's who!""Freshness Guarantee,"" my eye! A more appropriate name would be AMAZON SQUASHED.",0
Was very impressed with the freshness. They looked like strawberries out of an advertisement!,0
This is like the 5th time I have received spoiled or bruised fruit from Amazon Fresh. Completely unacceptable. Never again!.,2
Very good piece of salmon . I will continue to reorder,1
"After reading some reviews, I was hesitant to buy basically any produce from Amazon, but I decided to buy these strawberries anyway. I received delicious, perfectly ripe strawberries from California Giant. So another review I read is correct (which seems obvious now typing it out): if you live near a major fruit and vegetable producing region, say California’s Central Valley, you’ll get great strawberries.",0
"I ordered 4 about 10 days ago, reported them as bad.Ordered again yesterday (thinking it’s probably another batch by now)…nope. Still gross. Never again!",2
Lovely dainty earrings for a great price. Will be buying more,1
I received very discolored dried out mushrooms.  It taught me to never buy pre sliced mushrooms again.,2
"compared to other trawberries I ordered online, these were surprisingly fresh and tasty",0
So expensive Was not impressed with the quality,0
I love how the package is so cute and all of the rings..... I will buy it again,1
I won’t be ordering fruit anymore they were horrible,2
"I usually like to give delivery services two chances. The first time I ordered my strawberries were moldy so they refunded. I ordered again and they were fine, I ordered again and they were once again moldy. I will not buy strawberries again  from here. Especially since they were in an individual bag so you know people saw.",2
"Oh my goodness,  everything about my purchase from portion size,  packaging, freshness to taste.  So goodness.  I will definitely purchase again",1
Están en muy buenas condiciones frescas y bonitas excelente,0
"Honestly, the worst papaya I’ve had . I let it sit for a few days so it could be perfectly ripe and when I open it , it was a dull color and worst when I tasted it. WilI NEVER PURCHASE THIS ITEM FROM AMAZON.",2
"I have to say, I was impressed with the quality and taste of these juicy berries. The strawberries were plump, firm, and perfectly ripe - making them the perfect treat for snacking, baking or adding to smoothies. The pack of 1 lb strawberries were great value and lasted for a few days. I loved how fresh they tasted and how different they were from the strawberries I usually buy at the grocery store. Plus, they were sourced locally. Aside from their delicious taste, strawberries are also packed with vitamins and minerals, making them a healthy addition to any diet. They are a great snack option for kids and adults alike and can be added to a variety of dishes to enhance the flavor. Overall, I highly recommend Produce Strawberries to anyone looking for a sweet and delicious treat that is not only healthy but also versatile. Whether you eat them on their own, add them to a salad, or make strawberry shortcake, these berries are a must-have for any fruit lover!",0
"These were hands down the freshest mushrooms I have ever purchased. And they were pre-sliced, too! My partner isn't a big fan of mushrooms, but he said these ones looked so much better than the ones I usually buy that he actually wanted to try some- and he liked them! I sautéed these and served them with fettucine alfredo and they were delicious! Looking forward to purchasing again.",1
Very good !,0
"like everyone else, these are moldy! Never again",2
Strawberries already had mold growing on them. They were leaking juices out of the container and mooshy.,0
"My ears are extremely sensitive, I am not able to wear ""cheap"" earrings because they will irritate my ears. I was pleasantly surprised that these earrings feel very comfortable. They look great, feel great, very light weight. I will order another set from this merchant.",1
The food arrived as  scheduled. Everything was fresh. If the prices were more reasonable I would order more food products. I have ordered a few times. This shipment came in handy in a pinch. I was able to have the food delivered to someone else (another address).,1
"These strawberries were not only sour but the majority of them had dark brown spots on them. My Amazon shopper failed to check the strawberries thoroughly, again!",0
I order this a couple of times and was good but last two times a was soggy and tasted rotten. Won’t  be ordering again plus bags get mishandled and watermelon juice is always all over other products .,2
Delicious! Sweet! Beautiful!,0
"I have tried several times and each time I have purchased these, they have had mold or I received them on the last day they were edible.  That is it.. I will buy no more!",2
Never had strawberries so flavored,0
Some days a fresh good bunch & some days not,0
This is very hit or miss when it comes to flavor. Mostly bland flavor in my handful of purchases. I won't be getting these again.,2
Satisfied! I will buy this whenever I order groceries.,1
"Not that great for the price. 2 out of 4 were almost rotten and no flavor. The others were just edible. Very small for the price too, not the huge ones I get from the store. Will not buy again",2
"Kids loved them. But when they went off with their dad, I forgot for a few days. The raspberries were still good, but the strawberries were getting moldy. Not surprised as they always turn quickly no matter where you get them.",0
"Ordered two, one was perfectly fine… the first one I opened so my hopes and expectations were high, and quickly shot down when I opened the second… so disappointed because my son loves strawberries that’s why I have to buy them two at a time",0
Great strawberries!  Juicy & flavorful.,0
Package was already half empty when I got it and had to throw out half of that half cause of mold.Had 5 good ones though,0
"The strawberries came in super fresh and delicious, love that they arrived fresh and clean.",0
Mine were fine. No mold. That's about all I want out of a strawberry.,0
sweet fresh good taste,0
I won't be buying these again,2
The picture of the bananas makes them look so good.  Why do I keep buying these?  Never again.  They keep arriving looking and feeling like they've been kicked around in a soccer game!  They're always bruised and abused.  I must remember not to order these again no matter how good the picture looks!,2
Totally not what I thought they would look like. They look like costume jewelry and I will never purchase these for anyone again.,2
The Sunkist mandarin oranges looked good and I would purchase again,1
Bought two limes. Got two limes. Would buy again.,1
So disappointed. You can't even call these Mandarin oranges they are much too small. There was spoiled ones in the bag. I will not be ordering these again.,2
Fresh! Will purchase again,1
"I had no idea reading banana reviews was in my future, but I agree with the negative reviews for this brand. As the other reviews state, these bananas are extremely unripe when they arrive, yet my bunch was still discolored with brown spots, which my lay knowledge tells me was probably because of some process that ripened them prematurely. I have enjoyed unripe bananas before (no, not just Chiquita brand) and they normally are still pretty smooth to eat, with the benefit of prebiotic fiber. These were horrendous, however. One bite of that (after being in my home for almost a week to ripen) completely dried out my mouth and gave me a stomachache. I don’t need a Ph.D in banana science to figure out bad bananas. Not going to purchase ever again.",2
"I've been doing Amazon fresh for couple of months  now, and during my first orders I was impressed with its freshness,  flavor (SWEET) and size (LARGE that I made chocolate dipped strawberries). But the last 2 orders I made , I was very disappointed  because they were small, unripe,  SOUR ( even when I waited for them to ripe and turn red in my ref, half of them did not even ripe at all they just kind of dried up)  I just have to cut my loss and throw them away. Not buying again",2
"My first time ordering from Amazon fresh, I was afraid of ""fresh fruits"". But was not disappointed.. Extremely fresh and very tastry.",0
"The best strawberries for the last several months. Very fresh, excellent flavor and ripe.",0
"They are very expensive for the small portions you get, expect to use 1 package per person you're feeding unless these are an appetizer. They did smell fresh & looked good when I took them out of the package but once cooked the taste was terrible & unpleasant. A pungent, heavy fish taste that only comes from the lowest quality salmon. I actually threw most of mine away. I would definitely not order this again.",2
Great quality and timely delivery as advertised,0
I have ordered these on several orders and I keep getting rotten moldy slimy cucumbers. Yuck never ever again. Same thing with the English Cucumbers smh,2
Many have mold.,0
"These are very pretty strawberries.  If you want to photograph strawberries, then these are for you.  If, however, you want to eat strawberries, these are going to be a big disappointment.  First, they are hard to the point of actually being crunch.  But worse, they don't taste like anything.  Nothing.  No flavor at all.Not something I'll be buying them again.",1
"When I get strawberries they usually have a few hidden bad ones or go mushy in a few days but not these ones, they were firm and lasted till I finished them!",0
Good price for the size but was overripe. Very mushy and I ended up tossing it. I will order an avocado again but order the underripe ones.,1
"The last 2 times I bought this, the mandarins were spoiled and I threw away the whole thing. I rather keep going to Publix and getting the Halos, they are way better. I have to remind myself never to buy this brand of mandarins again",2
Mushy mold old and I’m pissed!!!,0
"Ordered multiple times in hopes of improvement. Worst brand I’ve come across. Not ordering again. Soft, battered or bruised or all three",2
I would never expect to find better produce through Amazon! Everything looks as if it was just picked! The flavors are amazing and my produce is lasting way longer than store bought!! I am still surprised!! I will definitely be buying all of my produce from Amazon from now on!,1
"Bell peppers always arrive fresh and crunchy with my Amazon order. They have some taste and are great for both salads and cooking; the peppers are quite watery. Sometimes they have some spots or bruises, but nothing too serious; they are good quality, just not the best. I will keep ordering them.",1
"I don't know if it's this time of year (November) or if Fresh and Whole Foods select outdated grapes, but find more than half of spoiled grapes and soft grapes in the packages.Will not purchase anymore grapes from Fresh and Wholefood.",2
"if your buying 70 rings for this cheap im sure you can assume there not gonna be the best quilaty. but, they are pretty good to wear for a certain period of time. they slightly turn ur finger green like all cheap gold jewlery but not as bad as most. pro tip: when the gold starts to tarnish and looks bad and blotchy i just throw them in the washing machine with my clothes and they’ll come out at the bottom scratch free and silver, so u can have silver jewlery now. but i love buying huge packs like this so that if they go bad i still have a lot more, i would buy again. came in cute packaging and hair ties!",1
"I was disappointed with these, hard, tasteless and awful. Sorry Amazon will not buy again.",2
"there were excellent, and at a good price. i'll be getting more! :)",1
"Be careful with this product my 1st time ordering they where amazing and fresh , so I ordered 13 more packs and of course they were not fresh and they gave me all the mini berries . It was like they gave me all the old ones  with Valentine’s Day approaching I’m sad because after spending 65+ dollars I still have to go find strawberries I guess this happens when you order bulk cause my first 4 packages was amazon , it’s a hit or mis guys !",0
"Ordered these several times. One out of 20 I guess times, they have been moldly or spoiled. I will continue to purchase but will wait 2 or 3 weeks before ordering again. Must of been a bad batch. It happens sometimes but hopefully the person collecting food items will catch it before delivering. Taste very good when receiving a good batch. Ate 6 in one day",1
The strawberries are sweet. Great flavor. I have bought 3lb but it spoil about half lbs,0
Received these on Sunday and two days later they looked like this. I will not be buying fruit from Amazon Fresh anymore.,2
I ordered - received about 3pm and the following morning they were already going bad - mold growing on two - I had in special refrigerator draw for fruits and vegetables- they were old strawberries passed off on online customers.  Be careful when ordering produce from Whole Foods - this isn’t only issues I had,0
The strawberries were the sweetest I have had in a long long timel,0
These strawberries have been the best I’ve had and bringing completely honest I don’t like strawberries but these I can eat all day long so sweet and juicy and fresh they come in a carton box not the regular plastic ones,0
"The fruit was definitely not ripe. Cut in HUGE pieces, but completely flavorless. Again, a waste of my money. I won't be purchasing fresh produce like this again.",2
Full of flavor and freash. Will purchase more,1
I loved that they were so fresh - not a speck of mold. Very pleased with them. Will order again!,1
"seedless, sweet and easy to peel. my kid and i love em. will 100% purchase again in future",1
Overall they were great with  a  good taste.,0
These were picked fresh and shipped amazing they picked these better than I do in the store they were so juicy and sweet  I love amazon Prime Fresh so convenient and I don’t have to worry about going into the store during this PANDEMIC and can continue on with my household things as well as order food while working from home doesn’t get any awesome than that.,0
"These earrings are truly hypoallergenic. I have a nickel allergy and even some earrings that said hypoallergenic actually were not. When I put on those other earrings, I still got a reaction, but when I wear these ones, I don’t feel anything at all, which is how it should be. I really like these earrings. They’re very good quality, are nice in appearance and they came in a nice plastic pouch … I felt like the makers of them and the supplier really cared to give a good product. I will probably will buy more different ones in the near future.",1
Obviously not as fresh as if you picked them out yourself. But worth it to not have to make the trip to the store! Ha ha,0
Never again will I purchase this salmon.. Cooked 2 days after receiving item.. Magots were tryin to crawl out & got cooked with it..just nasty..,2
Fresh and delicious  Will repurchase!,1
This watermelon was so fresh and juicy! I will continue to purchase on a regular basis. Absolutely delicious,1
I was disappointed. When I open the ripe pomegranate it was colorless and tasteless. Will never purchase this item from Amazon again .,2
They arrived with more than half of them already beginning to mold!  I opened them within an hour of them being delivered and was extremely disappointed. I will not order again,2
Molded in 2 days,0
I know that if I order a 365 product it will be fresh and in good condition. That is why I'm willing to buy new products from the 365 brand.,1
Amazon these were the best strawberries I have ever eaten in my life! Thank you I will be ordering more,1
not ripe enough,0
Soonfresh! I will buy these with every order,1
I was pleasantly surprised to actually receive fresh strawberries!,0
Im always skeptical ordering produce online but gave these a try.  They were all perfectly ripe when they were delivered and they taste good too.  They aren't very sweet but they are still good and very easy to peel. I will order these again!,1
I will buy more buy Strawberries from you! Every time i get them they are absolutely delicious! Store ones are always so yucky!,1
"We eat a lot of grapes every week, so I order 3 or 4 boxes and they are usually a bit different from0 week to week. This week the grapes are hard, and sour. I really wish I hadn’t ordered four boxes because no one will eat them and I may ask for some of my money back. I wil be ordering one box at a time from now on.",1
"I was so disappointed with this purchase. Beware, the cooking directions tell you to cook or grill as is, on the plank. I always wash fish before I cook it, and a good thing. This salmon had so many scales on it. It was not cleaned. And it is a portion for two not three. It cooked up dry. I will not buy again!",2
I can’t believe I bought salmon online and it is the best ever. It is fresh and tasty and easy to cook. I have been ordering it like crazy and I will keep ordering. I was a bit concerned when I read the bad reviews but I’m so glad I gave it a try .,1
"Strawberries was nice in size. However, my daughter bit into an strawberry that had an caterpillar inside. She vomit all day and haven't eaten in 2 days. Totally gross! Its official we'll never buy them again!!",2
I'm not going to be ordering produce anymore because these strawberries were soft upon arrival and molded waay too quickly.,2
turned brown quick,0
The spinach was fresh this time.I will try it again.,1
Fresh and juicy,0
"I can't recall ever reviewing a fruit and I'm 62 yrs old. What does one say about a fruit?  Ummm, it was good and I'd buy this fruit again. The end.",1
"Strawberries, 1 lbI received a carton of fresh big juicy strawberries. All of them were intact. I inspected them for defects. I really didn't see anything except a couple soft spots but that's too be expected. Overall, great strawberries. Delicious...5 stars!",0
Bright red large juicy strawberries that stay fresh for up to a week! Highly recommend!! Ordering again soon,1
"My 20+year-old daughters love these rings & so did their friends! Makes for great gifts, especially since nobody can afford gold for the past 10+ years. Elegant costume jewelry is currently in. The package I bought makes for great wear in the summer due to the stones set in silver. Girls show off their manicure with rings on (esp in the sun or bright light)! I will buy more. Thank you very much! Tricia",1
"These looked okay, kind of on the smallish side like maybe 1""x.5"" ovals. They looked okay but some were really with brown spots and crushed. Served them and they were sour. I've NEVER had sour grapes like these before. That stinks. You pay essentially $10.00 for sour grapes that are really soft and not nice at all. Not going to order these again.",2
Don’t like paying for something that doesn’t work(ripen to be edible) can’t get a refund. Will not buy again. Terrible,2
"These had to be some of the freshes, sweetest strawberries I've ever bought",0
Very satisfied with the freshness of the cucumbers! Definitely better than the average you would find in grocery store yourself. Will purchase again,1
Great tasting strawberries...can't go wrong with these!,0
Among the worst of the produce we received. These were half bad when we got them and the ones that were still good were picked too early and not particularly flavorful. Wont be ordering these again. Makes me wary of Amazon Fresh grocery 'specials'.,2
"Small, not very sweet, but ok. They weren’t sour, just not delectable. I probably won't order them again.",2
I have ordered these strawberries more than once and each time they are on their last leg literally. They are disgusting. Please step up the quality control on these nasty strawberries. I won't be ordering them again.,2
Felt hard and was very small. Won't be purchasing this again.,2
Fresh and lots of flavor. Just the right number of cucumbers in the bag.  I would buy again.,1
"Excelente inversión, ricas, frescas y buen precio.",0
The strawberries have barely any flavor and get moldy within a few days.,0
"Good strawberries. Large size. Fresh, sweet and juicy.",0
"This product was disappointing. The cubes on top were pretty fresh and sweet enough for being out of season.  There was NO discoloration. But the watermelon cubes on the bottom tasted rotten. Again, no discolorations, just a foul taste. It was disappointing.  I purchased during mid-Fall in southern California, so perhaps they just didn't make it to the stores.  I MIGHT try buying in Spring or Summer next time.",1
Super crisp and delicious. Better quality than my local grocery stores. I will buy again,1
These strawberries tend to get moldy very fast so try to eat them right away.,0
Always get a great tasting mango. Price ok. Will continue to buy.,1
Better and bigger than the ones at the grocery store,0
Okay,0
"Not fresh, not tasty and too pricey won’t order again",2
Don’t look at the other options- these are the rings you want!There’s so many that you can choose from depending how what style you’re feeling that day.. My favorites are the butterfly and snake ones. What an absolute steal and one of my best purchases on Amazon!!! 10/10 Would buy again!,1
"This fruit was so bitter and dry when It was delivered. Organic, not tasty at all. Not ordering again.",2
Extremely pleased with freshness and flavor. Better than expected.,0
"These were precisely, perfectly ripe when ordered and eaten over the next two days (ordered two)!  What a wonderful thing not having to wait days and days for an avocado to ripen. Would definitely order again!Love that Amazon Fresh gives you the option to order ripe avocados, which are ready to eat, and unripened ones, in case you want to keep them for some time.",1
This was really great salmon. It cooked up with a delicious flavor and was so tender. Fantastic! Will definitely buy again! Only thing I don’t like is that the plastic packaging doesn’t appear to be recyclable.,1
Sweetest Strawberries I've had in a long time.,0
I read the reviews and had to write one of my own. I bought three bags for myself and my kids. They were a good size bag. I usually buy Halo's or Clementine but very happy I got these. Much bigger and sweeter than the other brands. They peeled easily as well. Will definitely be recommending them and buying more.,1
Love the quality of this product worth every penny,0
Only one? Will not buy again,2
"it is fresh，I love it, definitely will buy it again!",1
"They were a few strawberries that were already moldy when it was delivered. The ones that weren't moldy were bland and somewhat sour. These were low quality strawberries. I finished the package, but I will not order again.",2
WONDERFUL PRODUCT,0
"I love these rings. they are so cute and affordable. they come with a amazing assortment of sizes and the best part doesn’t turn my fingers green. love, would buy again, and recommend everyone who likes rings to buy too.",1
Such a strong fishy odor. Weird coloring. Juices leaked all over the bag. Had my freezer reeling of fish. Absolutely disgusting. I will never order fish again from Amazon fresh.,2
I’ve ordered this many times and will continue to buy. Very good and fresh.,1
Papaya was NOT fresh! Won’t order “fresh” fruit anymore,2
"VERY SOFT when received... had to juice them...after washing of course. They were treated with:O-PHENYLPHENOL - KNOWN TO CAUSE CANCER, THIABENDAZOLE and IMAZALIL and waxes - also of questionable safety to our very organic home. Took a chance. Never again.",2
no fresh as i expected,0
This is just nasty!,0
"Rating was all different nectarines were hard as rocks. Pepppers soft, rest was good.",0
there was a lot of strawberries with bruised spots and also they were very sweet but i knew that i only had a small window to use before they went bad,0
VERY SWEET AND FRESH. EASY TO PEEL AND EAT. WILL BUY AGAIN!,1
"I was a little skeptical at first about ordering avocados, but when they arrived they were perfectly picked to perfection as far as ripeness. They were delicious and I would definitely order again.",1
"The watermelon  was so fresh and  sweet  , also they give you a nice size. Will buy again",1
"I have ordered a couple times. The first order was great maybe a little overripe, but I ate them quickly, they were sweet, the latest order was partially green sour fruit. Totally hit or miss so far. I am ordering again and this time it says Sunkist Smiles. I guess I'll pay attention to see if the description changes when next i will buy.",1
All but 1 shipment of these came fresh and a decent price flavor varies with strawberries so thats hatd to gauge. Overall good. Will buy once again. Fresh check your inventory before it reaches the customer!,1
"I ordered this 2lb cut water melon box, 5 at at time each week for months. I ate one after each daily exercise. Usually, 2 out of 5 have bitter tastes and look whitish from the outside and are the ones I could easily recognize as not sweet and wouldn't have bought if I had done in-person grocery shopping. Since you cannot see what you are buying in an online grocery shopping, you just have to try your luck. But, usually, 2 out of 5 are the kind of water melon box I would never buy during a normal grocery shopping.",2
I was very happy with these strawberries - fresh and delivered on time. Glad they offer healthy food on Amazon Fresh!,0
Waste of money. Smells like fart and old. A hole in a strawberry ‍♂️plus wont get a refund unless you return it don’t attempt you will not get lucky,0
"The night I got the strawberries, they were already gone bad. Its guaranteed 2 day freshness but after 1 day I had to toss the whole container away. It was not fresh at all. I will not be buying this again from amazon and I'd recommend just to go to a local shop to pick up strawberries elsewhere if you really need them.",2
They looked ok the top ones were ok flavor was edible bottom few had mold,0
Fresh but not like the pic lol,0
Very fresh. So good. I wish more chunks came in the container. Will definitely order more!,1
It’s perfect would order again,1
Best fresh strawberries I have ever had and the taste so amazing wow I was so happy with these strawberries,0
Good and fresh...,0
Not very fresh. They dont last long... goes bad quickly.They taste fine. Just have to use them quickly.,0
About eighty percent great flavor the other twenty so so I’ve got them three times the second time they were half the size as the other two buy tasted the best  I’ll continue to buy them,1
Wow! The plums I got were huge and blemish free. Yes they do need a day before I can enjoy them but can't wait for them to be back in stock.  Will order again!,1
nothing here,0
"The watermelon was mushy and it didn’t have a good flavor. We had it for two days and it started to spoil, not a good purchase. I’ve tried to purchase this twice and each time it comes mushy so I don’t think I’ll be buying watermelon pre-cut again.",2
"I usually buy this however the last time, the salmon had an odor like it had been left out of cold storage. First time for this, so I will try to buy it again.",1
"It was not ripe but as it ripened, it rotted and whatever I could salvage had no taste or tasted spoiled . A waste of $5!! I’ll never purchase that again.",2
Broke after a few hours of wear - waste of money not buying again,2
It is very difficult to find good groceries where I live. This service is a lifesaver. The strawberries seemed freshly picked from a nearby succulent farm. The strawberries arrive a pònt and ready to devour,0
Great taste!,0
"Good product, Fresh ,Will recommend friends. Will buy again.",1
"Taste much better than salmon I've gotten from multiple local stores.I normally do not like skin on, but this cooked up so crispy, so easily - I only used butter, salt and pepper and the salmon was delicious.  Definitely will buy again!",1
They vary in flavor depending on time of year - sometimes they are super flavorful (summer) and sometimes (winter) they are mostly under-ripe inside.,0
These shriveled up and started to mold the very next day. Won't be ordering produce online again.,2
These are perfect! Perfect knuckle rings! I wear a size 10-12 ring and only a few fit the full finger but the rest sit perfectly on my knuckle!There was also a handwritten card; nice touch! I will definitely purchase again.,1
I received a bad batch a few times via Amazon fresh but they made it right every time. Refunded my money,0
"Melon was fresh, perfectly ripe. I'll order again.",1
Great product will buy again,1
Strawberry is bigger and fresh. High recommend,0
"Nice set of rings, good quality, variety of sizes and shapes. Will order again.",1
"Absolutely the best pomegranete I’ve ever had in my life!  Juicy, fresh & tangy, i couldnt stop eating it even as it stained everything! A decedant, indulgent treat, better than chocolate! I count the days until they are in stock/season so i can buy them again ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️",1
"Our of the past 4 of these I've purchased, only 1 had all ripe pieces and 1 had about half that were ripe. The others were crunchy, harder than an apple. Won't purchase again.",2
"Arrived old, wouldn't purchase again",2
I will purchase again.,1
"This cantaloupe is the best I've ever had! It's so sweet and juicy, and the flavor is amazing. I will definitely be buying more of these.",1
Omgggg!!! I love Amazon fresh products!!! They make sure it’s FRESH!!!! Just like the name!!!! Good value!!!!! Good flavor!!!! Nice picks!!!!! I don’t even have to go to the grocery store because Amazon takes care of all products for me!!! Handled &&& Deliver with care!!!!,0
This was so unripe it could barely be eaten.Tajin was the only thing that saved the fruit. It was so hard and woody. EPIC FAIL! Never again!,2
"Do not buy !! There was a bug inside of the bag of spinach I had purchased. If I could rate this 0 I definitely would. I was appalled to by this bug inside of the ""fresh"" bag. I suggest not buying. Very disappointed! Never again!",2
Very good item and excellent shipping from Amazon Produce. I will definitely order again,1
The best I've bought,0
Great Peppers I will be ordering more,1
"The packaging is amazing, and it got here so fast. The rings and their shine are incredible. I always bought rings from shein all the time and they broke and turned black, this is honestly amazing I will only buy rings here from now on. Thank you so much I could marry the owner with one of this rings right now Jajjajajajajaj",1
"Loved the earrings, very cute, good quality for costume jewelry, would buy again.",1
"Previously frozen, it is not fresh at all. I’m currently pregnant and I have a craving for watermelon and this was severely disappointing. It is soggy, soft, mushy and unflavored. Amazon Fresh, do better, this is a joke. I will not be purchasing this again.",2
If you're able to go to the store in person it's easier to make sure you aren't getting any mushy strawberries!,0
Strawberries were moldy on the bottom of the package. This was the second time. Requesting refund.,0
If possible I would recommend going and getting some fresh. But these will do in a pinch.,0
"I ordered 7 of these and they never got soft yet turned a very dark green, almost black.  They were kept on the kitchen counter and even shared a paper bag with an apple for two days to help with ripening.  I continued waiting for them to get soft and after being patient for 14 days (I was fairly certain they should not have taken that long to ripen) I finally decided to cut them open.  All 7 were rotten inside.I learned after the fact that cold storage can lead to this situation. I live in Las Vegas so temperatures that are too cold were not the situation at my home.  Possibly stored at temperatures that were too cold at Amazon Fresh?? Not buying again",2
I like that it was a little on the unripened side when delivered. I waited about a week left it out on the counter finally cut it open last night and it was just perfect. Super juicy and really really good. I had it delivered through Amazon delivery. They did a fine job no bruising or anything. They picked out a better cantaloupe than I would’ve had a store. Definitely ordering again,1
Hard to see in photo but there is a crack (@ black spot) and whole bottom is squishy.Will not order again - dissapointed.,2
Most of the strawberries were moldy on the bottom.. won't purchase strawberries from Amazon fresh again.,2
Huge with a bang of a flavour,0
"While not as sweet I had hopped, it is early in the strawberry season and it is at least on par.More importantly, they were all fresh and good, NO bad ones and certainly NO mold of any kind.",0
"I order these almost weekly.  For the cost, totally worth it.They arrive green most often but are ready to use within a day or two. I have never wasted one of these bananas, nor have any that I purchased been dry and pasty.If you’re unable to get to the grocery store and want fresh fruits and veggies, Amazon Fresh is worth a try.*Will buy again, and recommend*Amazon Fresh delivery makes grocery shopping an effortless experience.",1
"Have been buying these for ages. Always fresh and delicious. Lately, berries have mold and/or brown rotten spots upon delivery or within a few days. Don’t know what has happened. I hate to keep asking for a refund, but keep hoping the usual freshness will be the case again!",0
These were battered and gnarly. I had to cut large chunks off all of them. Wouldn't buy these again.,2
"The salmon is sooooo fresh, I will definitely order again!!!!",1
"FIRST TIME ORDERED FRESH PRODUCE FROM AMAZON, WE READ ALL THE REVIEWS SOME OF THEM ARE VERY POOR REVIEWS.  SO I DECIDED TO ORDER ORANGE JUICE, MUSHROOM AND GRASS -FED ORGANIC BEEF SIRLOIN STEAK AND CRANBERRY ORANGE MINI SCONES ONLY. THEY ARRIVED WITHIN ONE HOUR IN 3 CLEAN PAPER BAGS, NICE , FRESH AND CLEAN WE ARE SO HAPPY WITH THE ORDER AND DELIVERY AND WILL ORDER  FROM AMAZON FRESH MORE OFTEN",1
Good,0
First time shopper  for fruit . Really fresh. Love it.,0
"I've ordered pomegranates from Fresh several times and with luck, they were sweet and rather large. Yesterday, 3 huge and nice looking pomegranates arrived. One was great while the other two had green mold inside of them. Super surprised to find the mold. Will continue to order them. Had more luck with good produce than not. Also, Amazon refunded the cost for the spoiled ones. Hit or miss, but when it's a hit, very happy.",1
"The watermelon looked as good as in the stock photo. So I was surprised when I started to eat some of it, that it had no flavor at all, not sweet, nothing. I did however taste the off-putting fizzy flavor and sensation  you sometimes get from melon and other fruits when they are starting to turn and ferment. I am not happy and won't make the same mistake of buying this from Amazon Fresh again. I will get my watermelon in person at the supermarket.",2
"Unedibly hard, bitter. Never again.",2
very good,0
i wish i would have read the reviews i will never order again was very over ripped threw it out! super mad,2
Strawberries were fresh & delicious. I will definitely get again.,1
nothing here,0
I usually buy my salmon from somewhere else. This was a great buy. I'll be purchasing again.,1
"I give up trying to purchase a RIPE cantaloupe on Fresh.The last 3 I got were inedible, hard as a rock and totally trash.That's over a $10 waste of money.Never again.",2
Tatsed and looked great when delivered.,0
Container was opened and spilled out all over bag. Food was warm again. Will never order from them again.,2
"When ordering these bananas via Amazon Fresh the picture of the bananas depict a bunch of bananas yellow in color and ready to eat. Not accurate! I love my bananas and eat one every morning with my yogurt. The bananas arrive dark green in color and need a week to ripen. Moving forward I won't be buying bananas from here again, i would rather go to the local market where I can actually see what I’m paying for.",2
It looks old and absolutely not fresh.  I think I’ll pass on these the next time I need mushrooms.,2
"I knew ordering ""fresh"" fruit from Amazon would be expensive, but I was confined to the house and was in a bind. I figured I wouldn't mind the cost if the fruit was good.It was not. Mango was hard as a rock. Plastic-y. Inedible. Nothing ""fresh"" about it.Luckily, Amazon made it right. I won't be buying Amazon ""fresh"" fruit anymore. Amazon does lots of things well. Selling fresh fruit isn't one of them.",2
Ive had a couple times now where the strawberries arrived moldy. I removed the bad strawberries and washed the remaining ones off and they were good. Just be aware they could arrive moldy.,0
"I really do want to love these, but Amazon Fresh consistently delivers these to me in the most awful ways. They come beat up, bruised and spoil super fast. However, they do taste good, comparable to Chiquita Bananas, which are my favorite as far as quality and taste goes. These are fairly cheap also, but I would pay more for better quality. I  won't buy again",2
Half of them were fresh and usable and the other half was mushy and moldy,0
"strawberry with fungus, dont waste yout time, money and health!",0
Most under ripe. But wuickly ripened on my counter.,0
Never again will i buy produce on here.. it was mushy and leaking once i opened the bag,2
Great quality.,0
Both times I've purchased these they've been pretty old when they came and have started growing white fuzzies within a day or two. Never again.,2
"I've noticed something very alarming with the fruits I've been buying. These strawberries were a deep red, I was surprised that they weren't moldy. Naturally a deep red strawberry is sweet and the inside is just as dark and is soft, mushy almost, NOT THESE STRAWBERRIES! They were hard and WHITE inside also not sweet at all. I won't order again!",2
"Probably won't buy fresh sweet potatoes from Amazon Fresh, again.",2
"Check to make sure the middle section where we can’t see is actually fresh. When we got home, entire middle section was rotten. I ended up tossing the entire pack because it didn’t feel fresh at all.",0
Bueno,0
These oranges arrived with multiple dark spots and they were dry and not sweet. Will not order again.,2
"Nice strawberries. No soft spots.  I was impressed that they came from Plant City, FL.  It is strawberry season down there right now.",0
I was very disappointed with this order because the mango was not ripe and it was too hard! I couldn't eat it so I threw it out! I'm still willing to buy it again and I hope it will be ripe and soft! I love them but only when they're soft and ripe! :-(,1
will purchase again,1
Absolutely delicious. Will buy again,1
It looks nothing like the size and fullness of previous ones I've bought. It looks like someone peeled leaves off and hastily repackaged it. Very disappointing. I will not buy again since I no longer trust the packagers to handle items that aren't sealed.,2
The avocados I recieved  were black and didn't look look freash I'm going to order again and I hope to get better quality.,1
Accidentally ate one before noticing mold. Got sick for a day. Yuck.,0
So tasty. Very good.  Will buy more,1
I’m used to eating wild caught salmon and decided to try this for the first time. It was fresh but dry. I won’t be ordering again.,2
I’m always skeptical about fish but ordered this twice so far and was satisfied ordering again now,1
Amazing quality and quantity for such a wonderful price! I will be buying more every month,1
It had dimples but I figured it was just surface bumps. Not so. As I cut it i noticed off-white spots throughout the fruit. There were too many to just cut away(I tried it). After all of the cutting it was clear...the cantaloupe was rottening. I threw it out. I won't try buying any more until 2022 melon season.,2
Flavor was on point but this was dry and I’m definitely not buying it again,2
Juicy sweet and fresh will definitely buy again,1
"I was disappointed with the service. Yes, Amazon Fresh saves time from grocery shopping but the avocados had a weird texture and taste. Plus, they were not ripe enough to eat as it states in the description. Totally disappointed, not buying from Amazon Fresh again, waste of money and return of bad quality produce.",2
"I typically buy individual potatoes,  but got this bag instead. The potatoes were old, had bad spots on them & I had to throw half of them away. I will not purchase this product again.",2
Fresh and delicious! Not any going bad!,0
Arrived on time... Great taste. ..Fresh and not over ripe...will buy again,1
"‘‘Tis batch was disappointing, mold included",0
My favorite fruit. Nice and fresh and juicy.,0
"Every time I get strawberries from Amazon fresh my kids devour it before it even gets in the fridge. When I buy them from the store they sit in the refrigerator forever and a day. I don't know about anybody else, but I was skeptical at first on getting fruit from Amazon prime! I'm already picky about my fruit, but I literally don't want to get it from anywhere else because it's so fresh! I know reading reviews is the thing to do before you to buy a product, but you don't really know unless you try it yourself!",0
A fresh bunch of strawberries was picked up and delivered.,0
My berries arrived in excellent condition and were delicious too. Never had any problems with the veggies nor the fruit.,0
Actually this was some of the best fish I’ve had in a while store bought. This was fresh and smelled great! Almost no fishy smell at all. Comes cut in two. I’m buying more after this review. Thanks for great product!,1
I love Cuties & other Mandarin oranges. Just won't buy them from Fresh ever again. Purchased about 5 times & they're either already bad or bad the next day.,2
"They are decent good sized strawberries, not green,not overripe like some stores",0
"I’ve been buying this baby on weekly basis from Whole Foods, the leaves are always crispy fresh and the stems are long and crunchy! It’s just so perfect, the most powerful ingredient of my smoothies. This week however I ordered the same exact WF baby spinach through Fresh instead and guess what, I received a bag full of oldish looking wrinkly softened leaves with short weak stems. The spinach in the bag looks totally different than the one I normally receive from Whole Foods in the exact same bag. I don’t think this bag was a coincidence since I can recognize the spinach in the bags at Whole Foods by the length of the stems, and I’ll not order it again through Fresh.",2
Too small! I thought it would be the same size as the average spinach bags I constantly buy in the store.. but it's half the size. Won't purchase again. I prefer the large tubs of organic spinach. Much more spinach for the money.,2
Very good. Will order again,1
thank you...,0
They were sweet and fresh,0
"even cheaper than kroger (w/o promotion) with the same brand. usually comes in fresh, size is big.",0
delicious! last a long time. i will buy often,1
"I was so happy to find mini cucumbers (it’s hard to find these locally) but was a bit skeptical about ordering them online because I was afraid they would ship me limp old cucumbers but Amazon (Fresh) pulls through again. They were fresh and crisp!Bag comes with 5, varying in sizes. I have now bought these two separate times with a total purchase of 4 bags and they were all fresh. Will continue to buy as I eat these with everything!Fyi - everything you see in the pic is from Amazon lol The cuccs, tomatoes, green onion…and yes even the Maxwell instant coffees. Yes, I’m THAT girl that gets 8372628 Amazon boxes a day ;D",1
Strawberries were sweet and tasty. Will buy again,1
"I don't like the fresh brand cut watermelon cubes. They are tasteless, stale, dry, and tough. I will never buy them again. I can't eat them. I am so disappointed. For my money, I rate it inedible.",2
Spoiled within 2 days of receiving.,0
"I don't want to sound cheesy but it is the best salmon I've ever purchased! The meat is fresh and I put in the oven 350F for about 10-15mins, came out amazing! Will definitely buy more.",1
Way too expensive for not good quality,0
"Lots of different options and sizes for a good price. I mostly wear the littlest ones (I have a grabby 1 yr old). They don't turn my ears weird colors, I love that I have different pairs for dressier occasions and some for casual wear. I'd definitely buy them again.",1
Never Again!!,2
fresh produce,0
Beautiful stones in rings. Will order more.,1
they did not last long.  if i bought them again it would be to freeze them for a smoothie,0
"No complaints. Fresh, large and tasty ENOUGH. Have had better but not very often.",0
"I prefer the larger sweet potatoes,  but if they were not available I'd buy these again. Would be good in a pot with other veggies.",1
It tasted like they dipped each piece in vinegar to maintain freshness. It was utterly disgusting and inedible. Neverv buying again!,2
"Very disappointed, brown inside and horrible texture, I won't buy these peaches again",2
They were fine. Some were not so ripe but that happens. I think it’s hard when you can’t pick your own produce. Give and take.....,0
Moldy!  Would not order again.,2
"These strawberries didn’t go bad super fast like the ones I get from the local grocery store, because obviously the ones sitting out for everyone to pick at are ‘older’ and you really have to check them before you buy. I honestly thought these would go bad quickly too. I wasn’t even expecting a good quality, I just bought them quickly at the last minute without thinking. Not to be cheesy, but they really are “Amazon Fresh!” I bought strawberries twice here online and both times they were absolutely fresh. The only complaint is that I feel these seeds feel a little more “grainy,” however, like I said. They are fresh. (:",0
This was some of the best watermelon ever! It wasn't soggy very fresh and definitely sweet.Alot of watermelon for a reasonable amount of money! Would buy more,1
"If I wanted bananas that were overly ripe, bruised, mushy and a day away from being tossed in the trash, I would've paid a visit to the discounted produce section at my local supermarket where items are marked down and ready to be used or eaten right away. Needless to say, I was VERY DISAPPOINTED!!  I was expecting to receive bananas that were ""almost ripe"" that still have a touch of green to them. Bananas that are firm and bright yellow in color, without brown spots. Bananas that look like what is shown in the photo. That's not what I received. And the funny thing is....I also received bananas in error yesterday, and they looked more jacked up and rotten than the one's I ordered. I received somebody else's order and all I could think is, I know that they are annoyed that they didn't get their items, but they don't know how lucky they are! Because hopefully, they were sent replacement bananas that looked like ""fresh"", ""organic"" bananas and not the hot mess that was sent to me.  My other produce has been fine. I guess I won't be ordering bananas anymore and just buy them from the supermarket instead.",2
"I love these!! If I could purchase the farm they came from lol, I would order more",1
Yummy,0
Really good salmon.I’d buy again.,1
"So I'm an avocado devotee. My favourite breakfast is avocado and bread and I could eat it forever. I am extremely disappointed by these avocados. When I first started using Amazon Fresh last year, they were mostly good. They'd arrive ripe and ready to eat, the inside was a homogeneous bright green color, and the avocado was tasty and creamy. Over the last few months, the quality has dramatically deteriorated. More often than not, the avocado arrives hard as a rock and must sit for 2-3 days to ripen. Amazon Fresh charges more for ripe avocados than non-ripe ones, so I expect to receive an avocado that is actually ripe and can be eaten day of. When the avocado finally does ripen and I cut it open, more often than not there are browning bruised spots inside that I have to scoop out and throw away. The avocado also tastes bland. I stopped ordering for 2 months after one particularly bad shipment, but tried again last week. Same exact issues but all were brown and bruised inside on day 1 and I ended up discarding all 4 I ordered. The one good thing is that Amazon has been pretty good about refunding my money when they deliver subpar produce. Nonethelss, I won't be ordering any more avocadoes from Amazon. I don't like having to make a trip to my local supermarket, but at least I can handpick the fruit I want and the avocados I pick are consistently ripe and delicious. I realize online supermarkets have their pitfalls, but I really wish Amazon would work on ensuring fruit sold as ripe is in fact ripe.",2
The Avocados were very very old.  I will never ever shop Whole Foods like this again.,2
This pack of strawberries was sweet and gorgeous,0
Nice And Juicy,0
I just got the delivery minutes ago and the spinach is it good. Slimy inside :/ Disappointing. I will probably not buy greens from Amazon Fresh any more.,2
I will buy again,1
"I've ordered about 6 pounds of strawberries here. Ordered another pound yesterday on a risk. The majority of the strawberries were mushy and past ripe, they didn't make it into the fridge and went straight into the trash can.",0
"No taste, bad taste.  I will never order them again.",2
I don’t know why Amazon fresh uses these bananas but they are the worst bananas I have ever seen. They go from green to brown and never ripen. This happened at least three times that I’ve tried them. I’m done buying bananas from Amazon Fresh,2
ｔtast good  but not fresh .,0
"My strawberries arrived moldy in some of the fruits, so I was unable to eat them since my stomach is so sensitive.",0
Fresh and delicious.,0
Very good thanks i'm buying more,1
The minute I pulled them out of the bag after being delivered I noticed how horrible they looked. They were transparent and mushy. The looked like they had been frozen. This will be the last time I order produce.,2
NEVER BUYING THIS AGAIN,2
Recommended,0
"I was very skeptical about buying online for fresh groceries and seeing all the negative reviews.  I was very happy to be proven wrong though. I purchased 2 pounds of strawberries. All strawberries in both containers were a good size, good color and tasted either really sweet or somewhat sweet. The only thing I didn't like was the bag it came in smelled like a smoker packed it.  When taking the paper bags into the house you didn't smell it.  But after removing the time/date stamped sticker, the odor of smoke lingered in the bag. That was true for the 3 bags delivered. Overall I am satisfied.",0
We bought a number of this (4 I think) of the 4 only one was ripe enough to eat. The other three were left out to ripen in a vegetable rack and after 3 months none of them got soft enough to slice. 3 ended up in the garbage still to hard and black to use. Lesson learned... i will not buy avocados online again.,2
Delicious and flavorful. Purchased more than once and would definitely buy again! Arrived fresh just as described.,1
"So I realize that every batch of strawberries are going to be different, because some can be molded inside. ANY grocery store will have molded strawberries. But this batch that I received was absolutely delicious. They were so plump and sweet. Perfectly ripe. I think if this were to be waiting a couple more days, it probably would have grown mold but it seems that I got them at the best time. I typically dice them up and freeze for my morning smoothies, but I think I'll order two next time so I can munch on some too.",1
The bananas are consistently green on the outside and rotten on the inside,0
Very fresh but not sweet. They are picking these fruits waaaaay to early on.,0
What I received didn’t seem that fresh and I probably wouldn’t get this again.,2
I was lucky to be delivered strawberries that were even better quality than what I have been able to find in the produce section. Hoping Amazon Fresh has upped its standard for good!,0
"These hoops are great! I have very sensitive ears and all other ones I’ve tried have caused an allergic reaction so I was hesitant about these, but I was pleasantly surprised! These don’t bother my ears at all! Finally I’m able to complete an outfit by putting in a pair of earrings and being able to wear them comfortably for the whole day. 10/10 recommend and will surely order more",1
It was spoiled looked and smelled rotten. Never again.,2
They were not fresh at all. They looked old. Will never buy fruit from Amazon fresh again.,2
"These blackberries were so fresh and sweet. I wish they were in season all year, I would buy them every week.",1
Wish I had taken a picture  of them but I didn't. Not the best but was able to eat a few.,0
"The cantaloupes I bought were HARD, GREEN AND TASTELESS. I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN. HORRIBLE. I want my money back. This product should NOT BE SOLD",2
"I’ve ordered sweet potatoes-the kind that are almost white inside-before and never had a problem. I have gotten rotten yams before but sweet potatoes were always great quality. These new ones that come in an orange net package, so they can’t be selected individually by the shopper, we’re terrible quality. Very small and shriveled. If they don’t offer them UN-prepackaged, I won’t be buying them again. A total waste of money!",2
"Don’t waste your money. The sweet potatoes are moldy, mushy and smelly. They should be in the trash can, but Fresh sold them to its customers. I will never buy from Fresh again.",2
These cuties were a little bit more expensive however they had the best flavor I have ever had in a very long time. I would definitely purchase these again.,1
These were horrible. Won’t order again,2
Good,0
These were sour and nasty. The color wasnt even right but I tried to  give it the benefit of the doubt. Bad idea. Not ordering this again.,2
I’ll never order fresh fruit from amazon again.The fruit and veggies are old and beat up and overpriced.,2
Good quality and value.  I will buy this product henceforth.,1
"DO NOT TRUST THIS INDIVIDUAL OR BE FOOLED BY HIS JUGGLING ABILITIES.  He said he ""picked these oranges fresh"" when I bought them, but little did I know, they were old and moldy inside!  FAKE NEWS!  Never buying here again.",2
Never again,2
"Slimy, stringy - seemed like it was left un-refrigerated too long or was way too overripe.  Inedible.  That sour / old smell that told you it was past edible stage.  Will not buy cut fruit again from fresh",2
These plums were delicious sweet and just a taste of tart can't wait to order again,1
"First and last time I will be using their delivery service. Poor quality products were chosen, I had to throw out my berries because they were moldy. Disappointed! What a waste of money",0
Well these are really convenient to order from Amazon they are very poor quality and very small I will not be ordering them again,2
We've ordered strawberries 3 times from Amazon fresh and they've been terrible and moldy every single time! Never buying again!,2
I will not buy again. It was so hard I just threw them in the trash. There was no flavor at all. Not one good piece In the container,2
Very delicious and fresh strawberries. I will order again,1
Absolutely LOVE this set! Would buy over and over!,1
Sooooo Sweet and fresh!!!!! Would order more,1
For some reason the bag is only half full!! Looks nothing like the picture. Half the pack is filled with spinach and the other half is filled with air!! I wouldn't purchase these again. It is fresh spinach and tastes fine otherwise.,2
"I normally don’t write reviews. But these are some damn good strawberries. Ordered multiple times and was soooo happy with them, don’t let the bad reviews scare you. Thanks, I will definitely order again",1
The sweetest crunchiest grapes known to man! LOVEEEE THESE! I will always buy them whenever I'm ordering something!,1
"Great earrings they come in different sizes, and my daughter loved them. Definitely would buy more.",1
"I love these! They are just the right size and style for work, and they are very nicely made.  I will be buying other styles.",1
Shock- a store prepared fruit that is fresh and perfect when delivered. Will buy again.,1
I love the amazon fresh options and buy many produce and dairy items. I am a working mom to a newborn so it really saves me so much time to use amazon fresh. the prices also are as good if not better than my local market. unfortunately every time I buy strawberries they come green or beat up. Definately not good to eat any time. Just not something I will buy again from amazon fresh.,2
What’s not to like stay fresh for a long time,0
Have ordered strawberries twice in the past month.. One time the berries on the bottom were moldy when I received them. Next time berries were moldy within 24 hours.,0
Very large and fresh,0
"Mostly good, but there were a lot of tiny sprouts in the bag that were yellowed and/or slimy. I don’t think I’ll be buying this particular one again.",2
"I like my peppers crisp, but these peppers had a weirdly hard texture, like I was biting into a plastic pepper from a fake fruitbasket. Hard and flavorless. Maybe I got a bad one but I don't think I'll buy again.",2
They weren't sweet,0
Fresh and delicious  Will repurchase.,1
"They are so sweet! However, some were moldy. Personally I would go in person to pick them vs. having someone else pick them. I had to throw away the bad ones (obviously,) but they are delicious!",0
Most were over ripe = loss of money,0
"I will buy my berries where I can pick them out myself from now on. These were picked so early they were half ripe, yet 2 of them had mold all.over them. Had I not cleaned them right away, I would have had to throw more than 2 and 2 halves of other ones away. i won't buy anymore!",2
"Some have come with mold already on them, and the ones that don't go bad very quickly. They taste good if you get good ones, but it's very hit or miss, and it's been a lot of miss lately.",0
Came fresh with Amazon Fresh.  Excellent product.  Great taste and portion size.  I will buy again!  Thanks.,1
I bought strawberries from Amazon Fresh quite often. This is the first time I noticed the size are much smaller and have lots of green leaves. The container is about 80% full. I know this is not strawberry season and suspect these are from the greenhouse. The flavor is better than the ones I purchased during season and they are sweeter as well. Thanks.,0
Stunning quality! Different sizes are genius since I like wearing on different fingers ✨ Beautiful random selection. ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL  Will be buying more indeed!  THANK YOUUU,1
Looks different now than since I last bought these. No blue container. Mushrooms are in a shallow foam bin instead of perforated plastic bin. Mushrooms are cut “thicc” and my scale says it’s about 8 ounces. There’s also a smell to the mushrooms as if it shared it’s time on the slicer with onions or something. I think I’ll not buy these the next time I need mushrooms. Not so “Fresh” this time.,2
"Why does Amazon Fresh even let these leave the building, much less deliver to customers? I have yet to receive a full bag with fresh cucumbers. Either half is squishy-soft on the ends or completely moldy/rotten. I've ordered repeatedly, hoping the next delivery will deliver and I'm disappointed every time. I will not order these anymore.",2
I wish I’d been warned never to buy pineapples out of pineapple season prior to buying this pineapple. I would have greatly appreciated it. Never again.,2
"Freshness guaranteed, great flavor. my kids love these so I will be ordering at least once a week. Desired thickness i usually cut thwm up because they are so big and we eat them daily.",1
Great,0
I have ordered these halos many times. I love them however my last batch came with a rotten orange. All good I will be ordering again but that was my last ordering experience.,1
Half the strawberries were moldy so I had to Theo most of them away. The bread was all squished because of how they were packed.,0
"This item was part of a Fresh delivery on Saturday, 6/25 and was put in the fridge immediately.  There was no freshness date anywhere on the box.  By Tuesday morning there was mold throughout the contents.  Blueberries, pints, also have no freshness date.  I would expect these products to last more than 48 hours.",0
do not recommend.,0
Love them the freshness was good will buy again,1
This is one of the most satisfied items I bought with Amazon Fresh. Super delicious. They are about 2 inch diameter each and very juicy. Easy to peel. Will purchase again.,1
Awful hard as a rock no flavor will never buy at whole foods again,2
STRAWBERRIES ARE WANTED AND WILL LIKELY BE LOVELY... BUT:BEWARE THAT AMAZON CONSIDERS AN AVOCADO TO BE AN ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE FOR STRAWBERRIES... AND THEN MAY ARGUE WITH YOU ABOUT THE SUBSTITUTION.Lovely strawberries if available and received.,0
a,0
Taste,0
Can’t wait for my next order,1
it looks super fresh and Extra Large. Will buy again,1
Pretty but flavorless. BWOMP,0
It had mold on it never again will I purchase this item for my elderly mom,2
to many times I got rotten ones I wont buy again,2
"Was little to no flavor, and half were mushy. Yuck. I'll not buy again next time.",2
First one was good! - second purchase was already black inside.  Won't take the chance to buy again.,2
Never again Amazon I want a full refund. I could of gotten it better at Luckys SMH...,2
They become within a day.,0
Not that fresh. Really soft won't order again. They need people to shop as if they are shopping for themselves not just put stuff in a bag,2
The cantaloupe had a wonderful sweet taste/ was in great shape when it came. Will buy it again. Also was great frozen for a cold treat. God Bless,1
Too bad I can never get a delivery slot anymore I didn’t joy my experience with fresh,0
Love this product and will be ordering more,1
We will be ordering these strawberries for Easter as our grandson can eat a pound after cleaning and cutting the tops off. Will probably order  3-4 pounds. When should I order them?,1
I am from a strawberry producing town and these are some of the best berries I've ever eaten.  Buy more than one cuz one will be gone too fast.,0
"Straight fire! Maaannn listen, these were huge and sweet. I will definitely order often.",1
"For the price they are very cheap looking and even feel cheap, the sizes are awesome but wouldn't purchase again, does not look like pictures, some of the rungs came bent and one came broken.",2
nothing here,0
Would not but again they went bad really fast,2
"Frozen strawberries do lose their structure, but that great flavor remains intact in milkshakes.",0
Loved,0
This was surprisingly good.  I will be purchasing again.,1
"Material is well they’re actually worth the money , I’ll definitely buy more soon! Great for a gift too only thing is I was missing 4 rings I only received 78 other than that they’re super cute!",1
Do people ever get strawberries that don't have mold?? It's always the inside ones. Gross,0
The strawberries was very sweet and fresh,0
"I buy loads of nice produce from Amazon in California, but the avocados are terrible. They are too expensive and they arrive 50-90% brown inside. I ordered a few different times expecting improvement. Nope. Consistently rotten. Never again!",2
Very happy with them. Fresh and crisp I would buy again.,1
"Please with the strawberries I received. All nice and red and sturdy, none squishy or browned.",0
I purchase this spinach quite frequently and will keep on purchasing,1
"They were delicious, very fresh and sweet.",0
Thanks you good quality,0
I will get them again.,1
These seem to turn to mush and rot so fast after delivery. Won’t buy again,2
Plums were fresh and delicious! Definitely buying again!!!,1
"I just wanted to upload this video because I was very discouraged to order strawberries from here because of all the bad reviews, but I received some today and they are in amazing condition. I wii buy again.",1
"I bought them as part of a large fruit order for the office.  They were way past fresh.  About all they were good for was blending in a smoothy, otherwise the trash.  AmazonFresh really needs to put more emphasis on quality.  I'll never buy these again.",2
Buy elsewhere if you can. These strawberries were not worth the money.,0
Love how light weight and comfortable these are! Very stylish and don’t irritate my ears whatsoever! 10/10 would purchase again!,1
Buyer BEWARE.Not even edible. The mango slices where unripe and sour. Taste was hard and disgusting. Such a waste of $6. I won’t order the cut fruit selections on Amazon fresh anymore.,2
I love these and the company is so kind ! I will order from them again,1
Don't trust to eat look funny bad,0
"Nice variety of shapes, looks awesome and durable. I may very well order again.",1
This is my first time writing a review. I just ordered these without reading reviews so I didn’t expect the hand written note but it was such a nice gesture. I love all the rings! I was overwhelmed and trying each of them and they all looked amazing! I already picked out my faves. One of my best purchases i would definitely repurchase,1
"every time I order this watermelon it is expired. looks okay but has a sour and acidic taste. will never be ordering this watermelon again. Thankfully, amazon refunded.",2
"I got two completely different papayas (one small and golden, one large and green?) and they were both rotting / inedible. My husband who loves papayas said we will never order these from Amazon again. :-/My other fruit and veggie purchases from Amazon have been fine so far.",2
Extremely disappointed with this purchase. I ordered 2 and both were rotten on the underside ( appeared normal on top) and quite mushy and sour to smell when cut open. Would not order again,2
Love these!!!!  every box is perfect. I will buy these with every order... ,1
"Very fresh and large, but wasn't sweet.",0
"Drier than I expected, lacked flavor and overpriced! Won’t be ordering this again",2
These are good when the price is right.  The berries are kind of small though but they taste good and came fresh with no moldy or black ones.,0
"Bad Quality, had to throw away on receiving. Not buying again!",2
Used straight and cooked with them. Both good.,0
Taste good but some nearly past their prime when delivered.,0
Woke package was fresh there was no rotten pieces. I'll Definetly but this product again,1
Yum,0
"Large, ripe and plump. Eat them quartered with whipped creme.",0
"Some were mushy and inedible, but most were very good",0
They had mold on them after ONE DAY!,0
This was the sweetest watermelon I've had in years. So sweet and juicy.  Ate all the watermelon in one sitting.  Will definitely buy again.,1
"Very fresh, great quality. Delicious.",0
I'll keep on ordering.,1
It was for me! Would buy again!,1
Some strawberries were rotten; others too green.  About 1/3 just right.,0
I ordered 6. All were very small and rotten on the inside. Hesitant to order again.,2
The fresh Strawberries come in a 1lb container and are ripe and ready to eat (after washing them).They have a great taste and smell to them.,0
"they are nice, i ordered 6 all good so farthey arent very sweet, more tart and sour but theyre juicy i will buy some more",1
"The first time I ordered these were good, and lasted a few days. With tje second order I had to throw half away. They were over ripe and dripping juice when I got them out of the shipping bag.",0
"Amazon Fresh is great for a lot of things, but produce can be a gamble. I purchased a bag of Mandarin Oranges. What arrived was not even orange colored. The bag consisted of very SMALL, very GREEN rock hard fruit. The photo is after the fruit has been sat out on the window sill and in the sun for a couple WEEKS. Most of them have still not become ripe. They are tiny. A fair number taste OK after they become more yellow / orange colored. But I won't buy them again.",2
Good,0
Very nice!! Fresh!! I enjoyed them!!,0
"Not sure if this is the organic as I purchased both types. Organic arrived beginning to show mold and the other was severely underripe, despite it being strawberry season.",0
"Obviously not fresh!!!Very dissapointed with these, my kid loves straberries he almost eat one of those",0
These were the absolute best strawberries I’d had in a long time. Devoured them.  I will order more.,1
Old and dried up. Tried ordering again. Same thing. Never again!,2
These rings are beautiful!! They are selling great in my shop. Very nice quality and great designs.  Highly recommend and will order again!!!,1
Great flavor,0
They look fresh. but they smell awful and tastes horrible. I don't know what's wrong with them. I'm never getting these again.,2
Expiraton day was the day after it arrived and it was brised. Will not purchase again.,2
I was shocked at how great and sturdy these earrings were. I love all the designs. I will definitely be purchasing more from this seller. Good quality. I recommend these.,1
"I am so disappointed with this purchase. I bought 2 and both has mold, was wet so all of them were wet with the mold, rinsed all and saw that some were so small, hard and black markings that we were not able to eat any of them. I have bought these in the past and my family loved them. I would peel all of them and place in a zip lock and put in the fridge. They loved this as a snack rather that something sweet or chips. Wish there was a way to know they will be fresh, I am hesitant to purchase them again.",2
"I know that fresh fruit (and vegetables) and not widgets churned out of a machine, but this watermelon needed a few more days on the vine.  We ate it, enjoyed it, and will probably buy again, but it was a bit lacking in sweetness, combined with a bit of toughness on texture.",1
Love strawberrys I love eating them plain or in salads,0
"Bananas came green which is OK..better than being overripe but instead of ripening to normal yellow color..see the photo...they are ugly meaning that they were taken from a refrigerator before delivery..the first time I ordered them they were perfect..I don't remember  if they came from ""whole foods"" this came from ""Fresh""...NEVER  again",2
All the rings fit on each of my fingers and I got little sausage fingers. I have not work them long enough to see if they will turn my fingers green (I’m very sensitive to costume jewelry so anything not 925 will turn green on me). But if you apply a clear top coat polish to the inner of the ring it will help with the green. Loved that the business wrote personal note in the package and threw in some extras! Can’t wait to order again!,1
Nothing fancy it's just a head of lettuce. LoL. But I've never tried this company before. May buy the same one again.,1
There okay they left stains on my fingers one of them actually broke but you get what you paid for there cute simple would not repurchase tho…,2
Fresh,0
Very delicious. Eat them in about 3-4 days when you get them.,0
Great,0
"You never know what you will get with Smazin produce. I’ve been ordering itemd from Amazon Fresh for years. Sometimes the strawberries are beautiful, while other times they are squishy and moldy.  Just know that you will not get the same quality every time. It’s disappointimg but honestly the convenience is why I stick with it.",0
Fresh and delicious  Will repurchase.,1
"Very bad quality and small rings, I will never buy from this seller ever again!I'm very disappointed",2
"I don't often wear gold jewelry, but occasionally I want to wear some.  I wore a pair the day after I received the order and was very pleased with them.  Can't wait to buy the rest of them out.",1
"The rings are great, great value for the money. The best thing a about the purchase was the vendor!Definitely purchase from them. I loved the packaging and the note left in the bag.I will definitely purchase from them again prior to shopping elsewhere.",1
This is my second time buying from this store and and i just love it . Be buying again and again .,1
"I don't have the money to spend on expensive jewelry but I have sensitive skin so I am always trying to decide between comfort or saving money. However, with these earrings I didn't have to choose. They are the cutest pairs of earrings I own. The wide selection gives me options for earrings to wear into the office and going out as well. By far one of the best Amazon purchases I have made this year.  I would order more",1
I did not have any issues with this product. Will buy these again.,1
became black and moldy within 2 days of having them delivered to me. I’d say go to a physical store for your fruit and vegetables. Never buying again!,2
"Had to toss these out, there was visibly a large amount of moldy strawberries in the bottom corner :(",0
"Fresh, very big and surprisingly sweet!Loved them!!!",0
Nothing,0
"I was a little skeptical at first because of so many poor reviews that mentioned moldy strawberries. This is our first time using Fresh—we are very impressed, though! They are large and a little dark, but our son much prefers the sweeter taste the strawberries get towards the end of their freshness! We also buy in bulk so we can freeze about 2/3 for summer snacks and smoothies. This batch is perfect for all of our uses!The delivery process was easy and quick. I tracked the driver in the app and was given the chance to contact him if needed. He also took a photo of where he’d left the groceries, so that was convenient.",0
"Mine had mold on it the morning after I received them, won't be ordering again",2
Arrived not even close to ripe and quickly molded.  Will not purchase these again.  This is the danger with online groceries talen over.  We're at the mercy of whatever trash gets sent out.  Very poor quality control.,2
"Delicious, full of flavor. Great for smoothies.",0
"I have a habit of misplacing or being a little too rough with ankle bracelets sometimes, so this was a great buy for me to have so many options for such a cheap price!Personally I think they're about the same quality you can get from a Walmart ankle bracelet but here you get 21 of them for the price you'd pay for 1 or 2 bracelets at Walmart!!Plus they're all so cute (especially the gold ones) I will likely buy another pack just to have extras on hand!",1
"This was our first experience with Amazon Fresh, and most likely our last. We were ecstatic that we received groceries delivered to our door within hours.  Everything looked beautiful on the surface. But later that night after grabbing a Halo from the day’s delivery’s bag, we saw that many were rotten or rotting. Then later when preparing strawberries, we noticed -once you took out the pretty ones on top- that they too were moldy. Amazon was great (and quick) about refunding for these items, but we won’t be buying from here again. We are in the central Florida area.",2
Seriously there’s so many and they’re all beautiful! I love this & would 10000% buy again!,1
I use berries daily.Haven't been disappointed yet.....always fresh,0
This is hit or miss. Sometimes it’s great and other times it’s slimy. Amazon made it harder to return so I won't be buying anymore.,2
Item came moldy. Check reviews before you buy. Not worth the buying,0
"I feel guilty about ordering this salmon. I care enough about the environment that I wash and reuse my Ziploc bags. That’s why I was shocked by the amount of unrecycleable plastic used to package 3 salmon filets. Other than that, the quality of the fish was fine, at a good price, too. Even so, I’m hesitant to buy it again.",2
Very Fresh and sweet I was completely satisfied.,0
3 of the six pairs have broken within the first wear. The only reason the other three haven’t broken yet is because I haven’t worn them yet. They’re cute and fine if you’re cool with never wearing them again after one use. Would not buy again.,2
"You're always taking a chance when you buy a bag of produce and it's especially true for grocery delivery. The fruit on the outside looked okay, but are flavorless or bitter. Several of the ones in the inside are soggy and past their prime. And a couple in the center were immediately destined for the compost pile as they were already moldy and leaking. As I said, you're always taking a chance on bagged fruit, so I'll not buy them again.",2
Usually I can eat about 2/3 - 3/4 of the pulp and the rest is too dark or has funny little vines running through the pulp. Maybe it’s out of season. I will keep buying. It’s worth it to me.,1
These avocados are hit or miss. They're either perfect or look like someone bullied them and took their lunch money. I will keep ordering them anyway.,1
I love mini gold hoops and this set is great to have. I'm always losing my jewelry so it's awesome that this set is so affordable. I will just order them and more again next time.,1
The strawberries that the Amazon Fresh team picked out were perfect! The whole batch was ripe but no were near the soggy dark red stage. Very enjoyable,0
"Chile has a serious problem with super mutant bugs in their farm raised salmon. They used 1.2 MILLION pounds of antibiotics in farm raised fish in 2013 (producing 895,000 tonnes). Compared to Norway only using just over 2,000 pounds (producing 1.3 million tonnes). I would never buy this fish again.",2
"I wanted to post a pic, for people wondering if the strawberries are totally out of season yet. They are a little soft, but they smell and taste delicious. Sometimes it’s hit or miss, with produce delivered by Amazon fresh. But I usually have pretty good luck with the strawberries. Occasionally, there will be one or two that I have to throw out, when I first get them. But, all of these look good to me - which is great, because I had a lot more cereal, oatmeal, and yogurt… If I can put strawberries on top lol!",0
"I love Shopping on Amazon, and I really love Amazon Fresh. It's a great service. 95% perect of the time or more  I don't receive items that are consistently bad,however,  I won't be ordering bananas from Amazon again.  I can't remember the last I can remember saying THESE AMAZON BANANAS ARE REALLY GOOD, OR IF THOSE WORDS EVER EVEN CAME OUT OF MY MOUTH. I can't even recall how many times I have ordered them from Amazon Fresh I remember I got BANANAS from Amazon I wouldn't have picked out because I don't buy green bananas that I do know exactly what local grocery store to find a bunch of bananas that are tasty because I picked them out. I don't like complaining, I don't enjoy returning things and I hate",2
berries were soft and mushy.  Lid was also smashed in.  I won't order again.,2
I bought 5 of these pears originally and thought they were kinda weird when cutting into them and seeing that the seeds had become almost like a weird black decayed area. I ate 2 of them and thought not a lot about it the 3red one tasted horrible and the center was awful completely rotten so I looked up online to see what this was turns out it's what happens when maggots eat the seed inside the fruit... had already thrown away the 3rd one but sliced open the other two and took pictures these were by far in the best shape compared to the first 3 however still unsettling that those first 3 were literally home to maggots I am gonna throw these away like the 3rd pear. I'm not sure if they aren't spraying these or how normal this is but to me it's disgusting and i will not be buying these again i also bought 2 from whole foods at nearly 2x the price and those ones were fine the seeds were intact and not black like how they look when eaten by maggots. I will not be ordering these pears again all the rest of the fruit I got from amazon fresh was good 1 orange was a grapefruit but other then that and these horrible pears my experience was good I'll still use amazon fresh but just never gonna buy these pears again. The smaller pear that is also asian pear was delicious however and that one I will buy again.,2
These are so sweet and fragrant I eat 2 or 3 t a time will buy agsin,1
3 strawberries at the bottom were rotten in one box. I haven’t opened the other yet.,0
They were just good looking and not sweet in taste was expecting them to taste as good as they look,0
"I found this for the best price here on Amazon. I buy pomegranates in bulk. They are so good for you; it helps to detox your whole body. The taste is even better than the price; it taste like little apples made into seeds. Apples are sweet, but so are these. I almost want to say they’re sweeter than apples. I can’t believe that 2021 was the first time I tasted a pomegranate. Definitely will re-purchase!",1
"So, gross! I will never order cut fruit again from Amazon Fresh. It tasted like it was dipped in white vinegar. Smelled like it too and the bottom of the container looked like it had a bit of vinegar in it, despite the cantaloupe not yet being ripe. Really disappointing and odd.",2
Had them for 1 day in the fridge and they were mushy. 2nd day moldy.,0
For my first time experience with ordering produce from here it was pretty much a fail.More then half was bruised smashed or molded already only had 3-4 good ones left. I definitely won't be ordering these anymore.,2
"I forgot to take pictures because I was so mad. The last few times I’ve ordered these strawberries they’ve gone bad already or they had super dark marks and they have even molded the next day. I kept them in the fridge and thought something was wrong but my other fruits and veggies are fine.I’m dissatisfied, disappointed and kinda sad because I used to love that I could order nice fresh strawberries",0
Good,0
"It came in a chilled container, so it was not bad because of the shipping issue. I eat a lot of Salmon that is why I am a little picky about the taste. In terms of value, it was on the slightly expensive edge. Might not buy again in the future and try another brand instead.",2
"Yummy strawberries, we loved them",0
very nice strawberrys would definitely buy again,1
Great taste but had to throw out half of them because they were way past being fresh.. so half tasted rotten & couldn't be eaten. Won't buy again.,2
"I sometimes really want strawberries even in the middle of winter, and these were flavorful without costing a lot—win-win!",0
Al ver tantas opiniones negativas de las fresas. Me arriesgue.. dudando las pedi ya que a mi hijo le fascinan!!.. creo que fui de las pocas con suerte!! Super deliciosas tanto apariencia como sabor!sin duda la mejor compra!!,0
Got the strawberries and noticed rotten ones abs bruises on some,0
Good,0
Very fresh strawberries and a good amount in the carton.  I would buy these again.,1
Delish and was fresh. Will purchase again.,1
