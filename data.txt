I am currently a lecturer with the Department of Information Technology, Bayero University Kano, Kano, Nigeria. I completed my Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Azuraliza Abu Bakar, from Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Malaysia in 2020.

My research interests lie in the areas of Data Science which includes areas of Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. During my Ph.D. degree, I worked on the identification of purchase intention from social media texts for revenue prediction. The study resulted in an article titled: Movie Revenue Prediction Based on Purchase Intention Mining Using YouTube Trailer Reviews.

I am a co-founder of the HausaNLP (www.hausanlp.org) research group, where we focus on research related to NLP in African (low resource) languages. I am a beneficiary over several international and local grants.

As a lecturer with Bayero University Kano, my responsibilities include teaching and supervising both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Currently, I teach CSC8303 Artificial Intelligence for MSc Computer Science program and ICT8302 Enterprise Database Management for Master of Information and Communication Technology.
